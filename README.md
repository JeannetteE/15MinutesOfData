# 15MinutesOfData
There is a need for being more aware and more confident working and communicating DATA stuff in the academic libraries. 
We (Librarians) need to become comfortable working with and understanding DATA - small, big, known - and plan inhouse training sessions 
locally (tailored the needs in our own organisations) - in order to teach each other and share the knowledge we all know.

The idea is fostered by two colleagues (Moa Hedbrandt and Jonas Petersson) from Uppsala University Library, that I was happy to meet in January 2018, when I taught and inspired a group of Librarians with a quick ONE DAY of "DST4L" training (https://github.com/JeannetteE/UppsalaWorkshop). 
They transferred that knowledge and teaching into something they could do and share locally, and I heard about their concept - "15 minutes of Data". 
I contacted them and asked whether they could be persuade to share that concept at a conference I was in charge of at the time called - www.creatingknowledge.dk - and they did. See their slides at https://noril.uib.no/article/view/2764

# "15 minutes of Data" 
I took their idea back to my own workplace. And asked colleagues and management, whether it could be something for us. 
The concept can be focusing all kind of topics/subjects, but the for me the main purpose is to share and provide a group of colleagues with new knowledge and new awareness during a busy work schedule, and doing so (15-30 minutes in total) during working hours. 

Hopefully we can be better to evolve together as teams and certainly we will become more aware of what tasks we all solve - an we can all become better at what we love, supporting our patrons.

This Repo will provide a few modules on how to start in-house training. The modules will be used to "kick off our 15 minutes of Data" at DTU Library and will take place every other Thursday all through this fall (2019) starting late August. 
Modules will hopefully progress as we learn more. And we will evaluate the modules after Christmas.

Inspiration when planning the modules comes from conferences, formal training and workshop I have attended, but also inspired by questions we get from our patrons and experiences we face every day as practicing librarians. 

And when it comes to DATA, we do not start with programming and code, we kick off with familiar stuff, in order to work a bit "within our Library Comfort Zone" - and then we can become better AWARE of DATA STUFF. 

Not everyone working in academic libraries have to become Data Stewards or Data Managers, but we all have an obligation to KNOW and communicate DATA in a scholarly and literate context, both when interacting with students as well as researchers.

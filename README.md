# 15MinutesOfData
There is a need for being more aware and more confident working and communicating DATA stuff in the academic libraries. 
We (Librarians) need to become comfortable working with and understanding DATA - small, big, known - and plan inhouse training sessions 
locally (tailored the needs in our own organisations) - in order to teach each other and share the knowledge we all know.

The idea is fostered by two colleagues (Moa Hedbrandt and Jonas Petersson) from Uppsala University Library, that I was happy to meet in January 2018, when I taught and inspired a group of Librarians with a quick ONE DAY of "DST4L" training (https://github.com/JeannetteE/UppsalaWorkshop). 
They transferred that knowledge and teaching into something they could do and share locally, and I heard about their concept - "15 minutes of Data". 
I contacted them and asked whether they could be persuade to share that concept at a conference I was in charge of at the time called - www.creatingknowledge.dk - and they did. See their slides at https://noril.uib.no/article/view/2764

# "15 minutes of Data" 
can be a concept tailored all topics - and the main purpose is to share and provide a group of colleagues with new knowledge and 
awareness in a busy week schedule - and doing it during working hours. 
Hopefully we can be better to evolve together as teams and certainly we will become more aware of what tasks we all solve - an we can all become better at what we love, supporting our patrons.

This Repo will provide a few modules on how to start in-house training. The modules will be used to "kick off our 15 minutes of Data" at DTU Library and will take place every other Thursday all through this fall (2019) starting late August. 
Modules will hopefully progress as we learn more.

Inspiration when panning the modules come from conferences, formal training and workshop I have attended, but also inspired by questions we get from our patrons. 

And when it comes to DATA, we do not start with programming and code, we kick off with familiar toosls and databases, in order to work a bit "within our Library Comfort Zone" - and then progress to become "better with DATA"

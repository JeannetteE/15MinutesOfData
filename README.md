# 15MinutesOfData
There is a need for being more aware and more confident working & communicating DATA stuff in the Academic Libraries. 
We (Librarians) need to become comfortable working with and understanding DATA - small, big, known - a way to do this could be to plan in-house training sessions, tailored the needs we face locally in our own organizations. What better way to do this than to teach each other and share the knowledge we all (already) know.

The idea was fostered by two colleagues (Moa Hedbrandt and Jonas Petersson) from Uppsala University Library, that I was happy to meet in January 2018, when I was hired to teach and inspire a group of Librarians for ONE DAY of "DST4L" training (https://github.com/JeannetteE/UppsalaWorkshop). 
Afterwards they transferred the knowledge & teaching into something they could do and share locally, and I was lucky to hear about their concept - "15 minutes of Data" - that really inspired me.
I contacted them and asked whether they could be persuaded to share that concept at a conference I was in charge of at the time called - www.creatingknowledge.dk - and they did, and I was sold.

# "15 minutes of Data" 
I took their idea back to my own workplace. And asked colleagues and management, whether it could be something for us. 
The whole idea and concept is flexible, and can be within all kind of topics/subjects, and for me the main purpose is to share and provide a group of colleagues with new knowledge and new inspiration in order to do our jobs better and smarter. 
Every session have to include some kind of "hands-on" tasks - and of course this means planning, planning and planning. 
Management have to support this, and Colleagues need to find time in their busy work schedule for about 15-30 minutes of knowledge sharing every other week, sometimes with a bit of preparation before attending.  

Hopefully we can be better to evolve together as teams and certainly we will become more aware of what tasks we all solve - in order to become better at what we love - supporting and providing service to our patrons.

This Repo will provide a few modules on how to start in-house training. The modules will be used to "kick off our 15 minutes of Data" at DTU Library and will take place every other Thursday all through this fall (2019) starting late August. 
Modules will hopefully progress as we learn more. And we will evaluate the modules after Christmas.

Inspiration when planning the modules comes from conferences, formal training and workshops I have attended, but also inspired by questions we get from our patrons, including challenges and experiences we face every day as practicing librarians. 

And when it comes to DATA, we do not start with programming and code, we kick off with familiar stuff, in order to work a bit "within our Library Comfort Zone" - and then we can progress and become better together. The goal is, that we all become AWARE of the new DATA STUFF, even Management.

Not everyone working in academic libraries have to become Data Stewards or Data Managers, but we all have an obligation to KNOW and communicate DATA in a scholarly and literate context, both when interacting with students as well as researchers.

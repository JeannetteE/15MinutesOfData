# 15MinutesOfData
There is a need for being more aware and more confident working and communicating DATA stuff in the academic libraries. 
We (Librarians) need to become comfortable working with and understanding DATA - small, big, known - and plan inhouse training sessions 
locally (tailored the needs in our own organisations) - in order to teach each other and share the knowledge we all know.

The idea is fostered by two colleagues (Moa Hedbrandt and Jonas Persson) from Uppsala University Library, that I met in January 2018, when I taught and inspired a group of 
librarians with "DST4L" training - and then later the same year, were fortunate to have them present their local idea at Creating Knowledge 2018 
- www.creatingknowledge.dk 

"15 minutes of Data" can be a concept tailored all topics - and the main purpose is to share and provide a group of colleagues with new knowledge and 
awareness in a busy week schedule. All because we need to evolve together as teams, in order to become better at what we love, supporting our patrons.

This Repo will provide a few modules on how I see the "kick off" at DTU Library when it comes to becoming better together.
15 minutes of Data will take place every other thursday all through this fall (2019) - and modules will hopefully progress as we learn more.

Inspiration to planning the modules come from conferences, classes and workshop I have attended, but also inspired by questions we get 
from our patrons and tools/databases we really have to "know better" .....

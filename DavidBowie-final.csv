Los Angeles?based critic, curator and editor Mimi Zeiger describes how these tropes, many of which relate to the preoccupations of the 1960s and 1970s, are recycled and repurposed by contemporary practitioners. She cautions that such feedback loops, orbits or revolutions strip meanings, narratives and politics from original source materials, which not only leaves a vacuum of nostalgia at the centre of the discourse, but also limits the discipline's ability to speculate on the pressures of our present moment. © 2019, Conde Nast Publications, Inc.

This study examined whether Internet search volumes for suicide-related terms changed after three celebrity suicide deaths (Robin Williams, Chester Bennington, and Alexander McQueen) and three celebrities who died by means other than suicide (David Bowie, Azzedine Alaia, and Paul Walker). Suicide search terms included suicide, how to suicide, commit suicide, depression, hanging, and suicide prevention. Observed suicide search volumes in the United States were collected from Google Trends for the 10 weeks before and the 2 weeks following each celebrity's death. Predicted search volumes for the 14 days postdeath were forecasted from the predeath search volumes and predicted search volumes were then compared to the true, observed search volumes. Search volumes for suicide terms significantly increased following Robin Williams' suicide death. Some of the terms increased in search volume following Chester Bennington's and Alexander McQueen's suicide deaths, but not significantly. Most search volumes for nonsuicide celebrity deaths did not change following their deaths. Celebrity suicide deaths can lead to significant, national increases in Internet search volumes for suicide-related terms for celebrities of high prominence. Results highlight the critical importance of reporting suicide deaths in the media responsibly. © 2019 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",celebrity suicide; Google Trends; Media; search data; suicide,depression;

The study focuses on questions regarding the nature of the Twitter community, types of emotions as well as expressions of fan creativity and the composition of online mourners. To this end, it provides a broad analysis of all tweets with #Bowie in the first 48 h after Bowie passed away (N = 252,318) and in-depth, quantitative and qualitative analysis of tweets with 100+ retweets (N = 130). Results show high levels of retweeting and a limited number of tweets retweeted exceptionally often, suggesting a Twitter ‘elite’ leading the online mourning. This elite consists predominantly of media figures, celebrities, artists and music industry representatives rather than ‘regular’ individuals and fans, resulting in limited expressions of parasocial relationships. Besides being conduits of expressions of grief and information exchange, tweets focus on positive affirmation in tribute to Bowie’s work. Results confirm that Twitter provides a virtual gathering of mourners who are (presumably) looking for recognition of loss and for expressions of support. © The Author(s) 2017.",celebrity; Celebrity death; fan creativity; fandom; Online mourning; Popular culture; quantitative content analysis; Twitter,,"Abercrombie, N., Longhurst, B.J., (1998) Audiences: A Sociological Theory of Performance and Imagination, , London, Sage; Bakker, P., Mr Gates returns (2014) Journalism Studies, 15 (5), pp. 596-606; Borra, E., Rieder, B., Programmed method: Developing a toolset for capturing and analyzing tweets (2014) Aslib Proceedings, 66 (3), pp. 262-278; Brown, W.J., Basil, M.D., Bocarnea, M.C., Social influence of an international celebrity: Responses to the death of princess Diana (2003) Journal of Communication, 53 (4), pp. 587-605; Bruns, A., Oblique strategies for ambient journalism (2010) M/C Journal, 13 (2). , http://journal.mediaculture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/view/Article/230L; Bruns, A., Burgess, J.E., (2011) The use of Twitter hashtags in the formation of ad hoc publics, , Proceedings of the 6th European Consortium for Political Research (ECPR) General Conference 2011, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, In; Bruns, A., Highfield, T., Blogs, Twitter, and breaking news: The produsage of citizen journalism (2012) Produslng Theory in a Digital World: The Intersection of Audiences and Production, pp. 15-32. , Lind R.A., (ed), New York, Peter Lang, (ed; Buckley, D., (2005) Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definite Story, , Revised and Updated, London, Virgin Books; Claessens, N., Van den Bulck, H., Parasocial relationships with audiences’ favourite celebrities: The role of audience and celebrity characteristics in a representative Flemish sample (2015) Communications, 40 (1), pp. 43-56; Click, M., Lee, H., Holladay, H.W., Making monsters: Lady gaga, fan identification, and social media (2013) Popular Music and Society, 36 (3), pp. 360-379; DeGroot, J.M., Leith, A.P., R.I.P.

An increasingly important aspect of stardom and celebrity in contemporary societies finds now that there are important ‘new’ and professional spaces for commentary, discussion and thinking about star performers and the various affects of fandom itself. Such is the aca-fan conference. This article develops notions of aca-fandom toward a new perception of aca-fan conferences built in and around star and celebrity figures, via specific focus on the aca-fandom of David Bowie. Auto-ethnographic methods allowing fellow fans to ‘story’ their own responses to David Bowie were specifically drawn upon in an attempt to delve into the types of emotional responses or tendencies to respond that are stirred by fandom. Primary material gathered in ‘aca-fan focus groups’ at international conferences on David Bowie highlights that this emerging strand of academia around stardom and fan studies offers a way to re-evaluate existent and deeply evocative star and aca-fan relations. This article critically considers the ways that David Bowie has become an emotive subject within the media-rich world around us. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",aca-fan conferences; aca-fandom; culture medium; David Bowie; fandom; stardom and celebrity,,"Bennett, J., (2001) The enchantment of modern life: attachments, crossings, and ethics, , New Jersey: Princeton University Press; Brooker, W., McKee, A., The best Batman story: the Dark Knight Returns (2007) Beautiful things in popular culture, pp. 33-48. , Blackwell: Oxford, ed; Brooker, W., (2017) Forever stardust: David Bowie across the universe, , London: I.B.

While referring us back in time, Bowie’s songs and videos simultaneously haunt us about a lost future. Bowie engaged with hauntology initially by mimicking the sonic, visual and bodily gestures of many star performers. This developed into synthesised mimicry, which involved fusing the traits of several stars in order to create a coherent star persona. During the last decade of his life, Bowie perplexed his audience by calling up his own ‘ghost stars’, reconfiguring celebrity and expressing a persistent sense of ‘future nostalgia’. In his last enigmatic gasp before exiting Earth, Bowie invited his audience to undertake a celebratory autopsy of his star status. His parting gifts were prescient hauntings of the future, poignantly stitched together with nods of tributary reference to artists he had borrowed from. Drawing on the concept of hauntology, this article examines a selection of musical and audiovisual outputs across five decades of Bowie’s career, demonstrating how he stretched the possibilities of hauntology as a conceptual tool and an artistic strategy, and prepared the cultural bed for audience members and cultural participants to engage with hauntological media. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",audiovisual aesthetics; David Bowie; gesture; hauntology; music video; Transmedia,,"Banks, A., The real life rocker who inspired David Bowie’s “Ziggy Stardust”’ (2016) Highsnobiety [online, , https://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/01/15/the-real-life-rocker-who-inspired-david-bowie-ziggy-stardust/, 15Jan.

Such interpretations usually use a liberal sprinkling of quotes from his countless media interviews. Yet the self-contradiction, half-truths, fabrications, and lies to be found in these interviews have their own corresponding story to tell. The subject of this essay is David Bowie in interview. Ranging from mid-1960s interviews to the most recent interviews, Bowie’s comments and pronouncements do not elucidate the artist or his work in any satisfying manner. However, what they do is provide a fascinating perspective on Bowie’s life and art. If we interpret Bowie’s media interviews as a narrative-of-self as well as a form of artist’s statement, what they continually reveal is that, to use Paul Ricoeur’s concept, ‘narrative-identity’ is a slippery process that involves both an affirmation of a definite self and a total rejection of that self. They also reveal that this ‘self’–together with others–is both the interpreter and the interpreted. In this sense, Bowie’s stardom (his fame) is continually under revision by both Bowie himself and those who attempt to interpret it. ‘Bowie’ becomes a collaborative project with no real beginning and no real end; not even in death. The celebrity interview is an important (yet often overlooked) stage for mediation. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",inconsistency; Interviews; lying; mediality; narrative-identity; posing,,"Adams, T.D., (1990) Telling lies in modern American autobiography, , Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press; Bowie, D., Interview (1972) Radio, source unknown but probably for US FM radio [online, , http://www.5years.com/radint.htm, Feb, Available from, Accessed 11 Apr, 2017; Bowie, D., Interview (1975) In: Cracked actor, , TV, BBC1, Jan, 26; Bowie, D., Interview (1976) In: Dinah!, , TV, CBS, Mar, 3; Bowie, D., Interview (1976) TV, TF1, , May, 18; Bowie, D., Interview (1995) In: 120-minutes, , TV, MTV, Sept, 17; Bowie, D., Interview (1995) Cited in The Ziggy Stardust Companion [online, , http://www.5years.com/quotes.htm, Available from, Accessed, 11, Apr, 2017; Bowie, D., Interview (1997) In: The O-Zone, , TV, BBC2, Jan, 26; Bowie, D., Interview (1999) In: Newsnight, , TV, BBC2, Dec, 3; Bowie, D., Interview (2003) In: Electronic press kit for reality, , Sony Music Entertainment Inc; Brown, T., The Bowie odyssey (1975) Sunday Times Magazine, , 20, July; Burroughs, W., Jones, L., The cut up method (1963) The moderns: an anthology of new writing in America, , New York: Corinth Books, ed., 345–348; Buskin, R., David Bowie and Tony Visconti recording reality (2003) Sound on Sound, , Oct; (2000) Fall, 2000; Campbell, M., Bowie’s different but plans changes next time around (1972) Associated Press in Ft.

The significance of this outfit, a seemingly unremarkable duffle coat, is drawn out in order to demonstrate the nuanced rituals, acts and structures that make fashion a set of practices and social relations as well as a culturally loaded object. This case study demonstrates Bowie’s transmedial flow between film, music, sporting arenas, fiction and television interviews and his related contribution to the transference and creation of fashion cultures in a pre-digital age. It considers the value and shortcomings of subcultural studies when trying to understand a culture that is not one’s own, as well as the marginalization of casuals within analyses of subcultures generally. This article builds a methodological framework that draws upon theories of costume in film, fashion in fiction and existing research on working class dandyism and football culture. Representations of this outfit in the work of author Kevin Sampson–an ‘active participant’ in these new cultures–are analysed to demonstrate the role that clothing and emulation play in the relationship between a performer and their audience. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bowie studies; casuals; David Bowie; Fashion history; fashion in fiction; football culture; Kevin Sampson; Liverpool F.C; Steve Redhead; subcultures,,"Ammon, T.G., (2016) David Bowie and Philosophy: Rebel, Rebel, , Chicago: Open Court; Armstrong, G., (1998) Football Hooligans: Knowing the Score, , London: Bloomsbury; Film (1967) Directed by Gene Saks, , Hollywood: Paramount Pictures; Barthes, R., (1990) TheFashion System, , Berkeley and Los Angeles: California University Press; Bestley, R., (2013) Where Have All The Bootboys Gone: Skinhead Style and Graphic Subcultures, , http://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/7612/6/Bootboys_Catalogue_LR.pdf, [online], London: LCC Graphic Subcultures Group, Available from, [Accessed 27Sep 2017]; Bond, M., (1958) A Bear Called Paddington, , London: William Collins & Sons; Booth, D., (1835) An Analytical Dictionary of the English Language, , London: James Cochrane; Bourdieu, P., (1979) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , Translated by R.

Perhaps due to Bolan’s own output being thus far relatively under-researched, Bowie’s relationship with him has also, until now, not been explored in scholarly depth. Thus, their mutual intermediality has also been overlooked. In exploring the links between the two artists, I argue that in particular, Bowie adopted and adapted Bolan’s early glam aesthetic, and further to this, that they drew upon each other’s carnivalesque personae, visual aesthetic, thematics and narrative structures. I argue that the intermediality between Bowie and Bolan also extended to a recognition, particularly within Bowie’s work, of each other’s media stardom. Theories of the carnivalesque, dialogism, and intertextuality provide the critical framework for what I contend is a dialogue between the two artists, in which they contributed to each other’s mythology and immortalised each other as the most important stars of the glam rock genre. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1970s; David Bowie; Glam rock; intermediality; Marc Bolan,,"Allen, G., (2001) Intertextuality, , New York: Routledge; Auslander, P., (2006) Performing glam rock: gender and theatricality in popular music, , University of Michigan Press,.

The memory of David Bowie as a celebrity was certain to live on via documented images, music and performances, irrespective of the cessation of the acting subject David Jones. When reviewing the single ‘Lazarus’ upon its release in 2016, British journalist Kitty Empire expressed an unwillingness to interpret it as Bowie’s swansong. Her rationale–‘the starting point for analysis [of Bowie] has never been lived experience’. Yet, this article considers how, had Bowie not served as an agent of his prospective memory and addressed his death directly via his final musical iteration, he may not have died at all in a socially networked society flooded with boundless media content. This article explores how the assured endurance of Bowie’s oeuvre and his standing as a revered cultural icon almost necessitated a reorientation of public engagement with his death in the modern age in order to acknowledge death as an end state that stands in contrast to ‘being’. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",extended self; physical death; Post-self; symbolic immortality,,"Ariés, P., (1981) The hour of our death, , London: Allen Lane; Barnbrook, J., (2013) Next day album cover, , http://www.barnbrook.net/work/david-bowie-the-next-day, Available from; Belk, R., Wallendorf, M., Sherry, J.F., The sacred and the profane in consumer behaviour: theodicy on the Odyssey (1989) The journal of consumer research, 16 (1), pp. 1-38; Berman, J., The 2016 Canon: David Bowie’s blackstar was not just a final album—it was an Omen (2016) Esquire [online, , http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a51474/david-bowie-blackstar-2016-canon/, Available from, [Accessed 24May 2017]; Bowie, D., (2015) Lazarus, , New York: Columbia; (2017), 15,.

Like David Bowie he can be understood as a serial figure, one who exists as a series across media. The notion of Bowie as changeling resonates with popular culture’s preoccupation with identity and a common trope of biographies in reading his music, film and art, yet there has been little attempt to acknowledge recursive themes and patterns or explore his identity as serially instantiated through and across media or read his story through a transmedia lens. Working with the concepts of performance theory and performativity, celebrity, media communications, actor-network theory and seriality, I ask about Bowie’s agency as medium for ‘his’ characters, a conceit made possible via McLuhan’s claim that the medium is the message (1999) and indeed, Bowie’s own suggestion that he ‘is the medium for a conglomerate of statements and illusions’. Drawing particular attention to the figuration of Bowie-watching-Newton-watching (after a sequence in Roeg’s film), I pursue the notion of a Bowie-Newton matrix, and speculate on the dispersed agencies–of author/actor, character, and studious viewer–behind Newton’s resurrection. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",agent of continuation; Bowie-Newton matrix; character-agency; media-consciousness; Seriality,,"Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: gender and theatricality in popular music, , Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; Auslander, P., (2008) Liveness: performance in a mediatized culture, , London: Routledge; Austin, J.L., (1962) How to do things with words, , Cambridge: Harvard University Press; Barthes, R., (1977) Image music text, , London: Fontana Press; Bochner, M., The serial attitude (1967) Artforum, 6 (4), pp. 28-33; Bowie, D., Walsh, E., (2016) Lazarus, , London: Nick Hern Books; Buonanno, M., (2008) The age of television: experiences and theories, , Bristol: Intellect; Butler, J., (1990) Gender trouble: feminism and the subversion of identity, , London: Routledge; Creeber, G., (2004) Serial television: big drama on the small screen, , London: British Film Institute; Crowe, C., Ground control to Davy Jones (1976) Rolling Stone, , 12, Feb; Crowe, C., Space face changes the station (1976) Creem, , May; Crowe, C., Candid conversation: an outrageous conversation with the actor, rock singer and sexual switch-hitter (1976) Playboy, , Sep; Cunninghan, M., Stage oddity: the story of David Bowie’s secret final project (2017) online, , http://www.gq.com/story/david-bowie-musical, Available from, Accessed, 9, Jan, 2017; (1976) The man who fell to earth, long star biographies, , London: Davidson Dalling Associates; (1976) About the film, , London: Davidson Dalling Associates; Denson, S., To be continued…: seriality and serialization in interdisciplinary perspective (2011) What Happens Next: The Mechanics of Serialization, March 25–26, University of Amsterdam.

Many psychological theories about the star-fan bond position it as a kind of pathology and so undercut fan agency. Conversely, Identity theorists often posit the fan as hacker: though this grants fans considerable agency it arguably does not describe all fan bonds nor agency itself. Before supplementing these theories with an existential account of fan agency, I suggest that any useful account should accomplish a series of tasks. First it should contribute to explaining the allure of a star, the needs of a fan, and the uses to which the star is put in the fan's life. It should also help distinguish the unity and variety among a star's works while also helping reveal larger 'stages' in the star's career. Arguably it should help us make distinctions among the types of stars, fandoms, and artistic genres. I use the polyphonic stardom of David Bowie to illustrate how celebrity serves different ‘navigational functions’ for fans (Mendes & Perrott, 2019). From his early work (marked by strategies for increasing existential possibility) to his last two albums and his video for Blackstar (2015) (where he dragged necessity into the light), Bowie utilized many of Soren Kierkegaard's existential strategies. Like Kierkegaard's, Bowie's stardom is carefully designed to not be a singular signpost allowing all fans to reach one destination through imitation but instead increases fan agency while letting different fans steer towards different self-narrating goals. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Blackstar; Bowie; celebrity; Existentialism; Kierkegaard; necessity; psychomachia,,"Anderson, B., (1991) Imagined communities: reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism, , London: Verso; Cinque, T., Redmond, S., Lazarus Rises: Storying the Self in the Migrant Fandom of David Bowie (2016) IASPM@Journal, 6 (1), pp. 7-24; D’Adamo, A., (2013), Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Press,.

The purpose is to illustrate the dialectic tension between me/not-me as developed by Donald W. Winnicott (1953) who determined, in the early development of the child, the first distinctions between me and not-me that contribute to the construction of the transitional object and alongside to that of cultural activity. Method: In order to discuss the concept, the author analyses the art corpus of David Bowie (1949–2016) – one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, combining artistic practices as varied as that of singer, composer, musician, songwriter, dancer, movie and theatre actor, and painter. Results: After examining four aspects of the dynamics me/not-me for this artist, – his avatars in Nicolas Roeg's cult movie The man who fell to earth (1978), his theatre adaptation of Elephant Man (1980), and his clip Lazarus (2015), it appears to be the dialectic tension between me/not-me that fuels David Bowie's multifaceted art corpus. Discussion: As a matrix of later object distinctions, Winnicott's “me/not-me” could be heuristic in our further understanding of the creative process and its psychic dynamics. Conclusion: More research is required on other corpuses to test these first hypotheses. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Avatar; David Bowie; Me/not-me; Metamorphosis; Winnicott DW,adaptation; Article; dancing; human; metamorphosis; metapsychology; musician,"David Bowie is..

While Byron performs this investigation largely through his poetry, Bowie performs it via both his lyrics and his stagecraft, as well as via his assumption of numerous different personae throughout his career. This article examines Bowie's questioning of the concept of stable identity during the 1973-82 period, linking it to similar explorations by Byron and emphasising ways in which Bowie extends Byron's thinking, and the thinking of those Enlightenment philosophers on whom Byron built, toward new possibilities. It argues that, while not necessarily engaging with Byron consciously, Bowie nonetheless continues the interrogation of identity that Byron began. © 2018 Byron Journal.

That legacy is clearest in Bowie’s subversive reuse of popular culture signs in his music, lyrics, and appearance. This article examines the legacy of Bowie’s glam semiotics through the film Velvet Goldmine. The film, in its newly composed songs and its visual references, uses Bowie’s mode of composition to reshape history and create a community around that legacy. Through semiotic analysis of Bowie’s songs, Velvet Goldmine, and fan responses to the film, this article argues that Bowie’s glam semiotics lives on in the self-defining work of fans. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Ali, B., Wallace, H., Out of This World: Ziggy Stardust and the Spatial Interplay of Lyrics, Vocals, and Performance (2015) David Bowie: Critical Approaches, pp. 263-279. , Devereux E., Dillane A., Power M.J., (eds), New York, NY: Routledge, Print, and,.

Drawing on two dynamic models from two different modes of enquiry - the circuit of celebrity culture and the circuit of celebrity affect - this book explores the multi-layered, multi-faceted contexts and concepts that sit within and surround the study of celebrity. Through building a critical story about celebrity, Sean Redmond discusses key topics such as identity and representation; the celebrity body; the consumption of celebrity and celebrity culture; and the sensory connection between fans and celebrities, gender, activism, gossip and toxicity.Including case studies on Miley Cyrus, David Bowie, Scarlett Johansson and Kate Winslet, Celebrity is a dynamic and topical volume ideal for students and academics in celebrity and cultural studies. © 2019 Sean Redmond.

In this article, Finnis’s efforts at revival are assessed by way of comparison with—and, indeed, contrast to—the life and art of musician David Bowie. In spite of their extravagant differences, there exist significant points of connection that allow Bowie to be used in interpreting Finnis’s natural law. Bowie’s work—for all its appeals to a Nietzschean ground zero for normative values—shares Finnis’s concern with ordering affairs in a way that will realise humanity’s great potential. In presenting enchanted worlds and evolved characters as an antidote to all that is drab and pointless, Bowie has something to tell his audience about how human beings can thrive. Likewise, natural law holds that a legal system should include certain content that guides people towards a life of “flourishing”. Bowie and Finnis look to the past, plundering it for inspiration and using it as fuel to boost humankind forward. The analogy of Natural Law and Natural Rights and Bowie’s magpie-like relationship to various popular music traditions ultimately reveals that natural law theory is not merely an objective and unchanging edict to be followed without question, but a legacy that is to be recreated by those who carry it into the future. Law’s instruments of critique must not forget these transformative qualities. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",David Bowie; John Finnis; Law and music; Natural law,,"Aiyar, S., The Problem of Law’s Authority: John Finnis and Joseph Raz on Legal Obligation (2000) Law and Philosophy, 19 (4), pp. 465-489; Althusser, L., (2005) For Marx, , Verso, London; Aquinas, T., (2006) Summa Theologiae, , Hayes Barton Press, Raleigh; Bainbridge, J., This is the Authority.

The impact of David Bowie, Prince and Bob Dylan, for example, on diversity awareness and legislative reform relating to sexuality, gender and racial equality respectively is still felt; with the latter receiving a Nobel Prize in 2016 for ‘having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition’. The influence of these composers and performers reached far beyond the concert hall. Conversely, musical propaganda has been a common feature of many dictatorships, most notably Nazism’s Adolf Hitler and Communism’s Joseph Stalin, and is still instrumental in the election campaigns of political parties. US President Donald Trump’s winning retro classic rock campaign playlist conveyed an idealised version of the past which aligned with the tastes and interests of his core constituency, and evoked feelings of nationalistic pride and patriotism. The eclectic selection of upbeat music effectively masked the underlying capitalist initiatives, corporate greed and allegations of financial impropriety that characterised both the Democrat and Republican campaigns. Although unable to impart meaning with the same level of precision as language, music has a potentially broader semantic capacity due to its greater elasticity. It constitutes a common language which has the ability to create a community of people that sings, speaks, reasons, votes and even feels the same way. Accordingly, this article explores the symbiotic relationship between music and law, identity politics and social justice, via the lens of musical semiosis. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Aesthetics; Culture; Identity; Justice; Law; Music,,"Adorno, T.W., Introduction to the sociology of music, trans.

However, Bowie also constructed personae through his remarkably supple voice. In addition to the physiological manipulation of his voice, Bowie also used various kinds of studio processing techniques to create an additional ‘mask’ between performer and listener. In this article, I survey Bowie’s use of electronic voice-modifying technology—ranging from studio techniques that are more ‘transparent’ to those that radically disfigure Bowie’s vocal identity—considering the dramaturgical implications of these diverse voices. I also consider the intertextual implications of Bowie’s various singing styles and modification techniques in the later years of his career. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",David Bowie; Intertextuality; Persona; Popular Music; Recording; Technology; Voice,,"Arnheim, R., (1971) Radio, , Translated by Margaret Ludwig, and Herbert Read, New York: Arno Press and the New York Times; Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, MI; (2017) David Bowie: The Last Five Years; Buckley, D., (2010) Strange Fascination: David Bowie—The Definitive Story, , London: Virgin Books; Cinque, T., Moore, C., Redmond, S., (2015) Enchanting David Bowie: Space, Time, Body, Memory, , New York: Bloomsbury, and, eds; Cone, E.T., (1972) The Composer’s Voice, , Berkeley: University of California Press, CA; (1979) Capital Radio Studio Recording (Bootleg), Recorded 14 May 1979; Coscarelli, J., (2016), https://www.nytimes.com/live/david-bowie-in-memoriam/black-star-david-bowies-connection-to-elvis-presley, ‘Black Star’: David Bowie’s Connection to Elvis Presley.

Scholars generally concur that music’s cultural role is inseparable from its articulation of sexual identity, sexual desire, and gender roles. While David Bowie is often lauded for disrupting the gender and sexual orthodoxies of his time, the sexualities embodied in or suggested by his music are neither liberating nor celebratory per se. I term these in this article as ‘critical sexualities’: faulty, collapsing, morbid, and dissatisfying. By mapping the trajectories of blocked desire drawn across the length of Bowie’s oeuvre—from his much-neglected self-titled debut album, through classics such as Ziggy Stardust and Let’s Dance, to his final studio work Blackstar—I offer a detailed analysis of the artistic means by which Bowie’s music helps problematise the very conditions of possibility of a ‘normative’ sexuality in post-industrial societies and postmodern culture. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Androgyny; David Bowie; Glam rock; Liberation; Orientalism; sexuality,,"Adorno, T.W., (2002) Aesthetic Theory, , London: Continuum,.

The adolescent is a temporally in-between figure, sited ambiguously between past and future—a position analogous to that into which bisexuality is cast in monosexist discourse. Thus, bisexualities become a point from which to approach literary texts ‘immaturely.’ The article argues that the positioning of bisexuality as a phase en route to fixed monosexual identity is a product of a broader investment in teleological narratives of maturation. Given its distinct relations to narrative temporality when denigrated as ‘immature,’ a critical focus on bisexuality can offer a site for resistance to this restrictive narrativity. The Buddha of Suburbia proves an exemplary text. The article reads Hanif Kureishi's novel, TV adaptation, and David Bowie's album to explore their bisexual textuality. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",adolescence; bisexuality; heteronormativity; narratives; television,,"Ahmed, S., (2006) Queer phenomenology: Orientations, objects, others, , Durham, NC, London, England: Duke University Press; (1997) The bisexual imaginary: Representation, identity, and desire, , London, England: Cassell,.

However, not all celebrities or their families are open about the exact cause of death. Anecdotal reports suggest that some do not reveal the exact cause of death due to fears of stigma associated with the specific type of cancer. However, empirical evidence regarding whether or how the cause of death actually impacts public perceptions and behaviors is lacking. A three (cause of death: nonspecified cancer, liver cancer, or lung cancer) by two (celebrity obituary: David Bowie or Alan Rickman) fully factorial between-subjects online experiment (N = 390) tested a proposed model of effects on identification, discrete emotional reactions, stigma-related perceptions, and behavioral intentions. Results suggest that specific causes of death do not have a direct impact on stigma but they can alter identification and emotional reactions, such as compassion and anxiety, which subsequently shape stigma-related perceptions and behavioral intentions. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,behavior; Death; Emotions; Female; human; Internet; Male; mortality; Neoplasms; Perception; psychology; public figure; questionnaire; Social Stigma; Death; Emotions; Famous Persons; Female; Humans; Intention; Internet; Male; Neoplasms; Perception; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires,"Bandura, A., (1986) Social foundations of thought and action: A social cognitive theory, , Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall; Bandura, A., Social cognitive theory of mass communication (2001) Media Psychology, 3, pp. 265-299; Bandura, A., Health promotion by social cognitive means (2004) Health Education and Behavior, 31, pp. 143-164; Basil, M.D., Identification as a mediator of celebrity effects (1996) Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media, 40, pp. 478-495; Batson, C.D., Polycarpou, M.P., Harmon-Jones, E., Imhoff, H.J., Mitchener, E.C., Bednar, L.L., Highberger, L., Empathy and attitudes: Can feeling for a member of a stigmatized group improve feelings toward the group?

Yet, most creativity-based organizations, careers, and professions, science and biotechnology innovation included, emphasize the speed as the prevailing ideology. But a narrow focus on speed has several and overlooked shortcomings. For example, it does not offer the opportunity to draw from, and stitch together disparate concepts and practices for truly disruptive innovation. Preventing false starts, learning from others' or our own mistakes, and customizing innovations for local community needs are difficult in a speed-hungry innovation ecosystem. We introduce a new strategy, the Fast-Second Winner, specifically in relation to global development of biotechnologies and precision medicine. This à la carte global development strategy envisions a midstream entry into the innovation ecosystem. Moreover, we draw from the works of the late David Bowie who defied rigid classifications as an artist and prolific innovator, and introduce the concept and practice of slow innovation that bodes well with the Fast-Second Winner strategy. A type of slow innovation, the Fast-Second Winner is actually fast and sustainable in the long term, and efficient by reducing false starts in new precision medicine application contexts and geographies, learning from other innovators' failures, and shaping innovations for the local community needs. The establishment of Centers for Fast-Second Innovation (CFSIs), and their funding, for example, by crowdfunding and other innovative mechanisms, could be timely for omics and precision medicine global development. If precision medicine is about tailoring drug treatments and various health interventions to individuals, we suggest to start from tailoring new ideas, and focus not only on how much we innovate but also what and how we innovate. In principle, the Fast-Second Winner can be applied to omics and other biotechnology responsible development in medical practice or any field of applied innovation. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",biomarkers and diagnostics; David Bowie; precision medicine; Slow innovation; technology foresight; the fast-second winner,Article; biomedicine; consultation; cytology; ethics; human; interpersonal communication; medical society; molecular biology; politics; prejudice; priority journal; publication; science; Biotechnology; Genetic Association Studies; Genomics; Global Health; personalized medicine; trends; biological marker; Biomarkers; Biotechnology; Genetic Association Studies; Genomics; Global Health; Humans; Precision Medicine,"Birch, K., We have never been neoliberal (2015) A Manifesto for A Doomed Youth, , Alresford, United Kingdom: Zero Books; Birch, K., Tyfield, D., Theorizing the bioeconomy: Biovalue, biocapital, bioeconomics or.

In life, pop culture fans can have parasocial (one-sided, mediated) relationships with celebrities. Yet when fans of departed celebrities express their grief in public comment threads, conversations often result in disagreements about how to grieve. These disagreements consistently appear in response to the deaths of public figures, and have been broadly labeled ""grief policing."" We performed a thematic analysis of public Facebook comments responding to the deaths of Alan Rickman, David Bowie, and Prince. Our findings describe prominent grief policing practices and explain how commenters may be importing norms from other contexts when shared spaces consist of transient interactions that make norm formation difficult. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of how conflicting norms affect discourse in transient online spaces.

Regulation is understood here to comprise intersections between various structures within a culture that might limit or delimit the use of a ‘text’ be it art, music or film. That is, regulation is an articulation of a number of formal and informal processes that lead to contingent and variable outcomes for (on a micro-level) listening/viewing bodies and (at the macro level) societies in general. Widely divergent perspectives on the weight of creative texts in society exist, offering complexity to the study of media as more than simply industries and technologies on one hand, and audiences and what they ‘do’ with the media on the other. This article considers that the ways David Bowie has become significant within the media-rich world around us. The purpose is to comprehend David Bowie via regulation on the circuit of culture in an interpretive analysis of this ‘moment’ with a specific focus on exploring ontological issues to do with the cultural politics of key forms of regulation brought forth by and surrounding David Bowie’s dynamic and frequently contested works. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Anderson, P., (2017) The Antinomies of Antonio Gramsci, , London: Verso; Bailey, D.S., (1955) Homosexuality and the Western Christian Tradition, , London: Longmans, Green; Bakhtin, M., (1984) Rabelais and His World, , Bloomington: Indiana University Press; Barnes, R., (1996) The 20th-Century Art Book, , London: Phaidon Press; (2016) David Bowie: A Jukebox of Your Memories, , http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160111davidbowieajukeboxofyourmemories; Breton, A., How It All Began: André Breton Comments on the Origination of the Cadavre Exquis, , http://exquisitecorpse.com/definition/bretons_remembrances.html; Burton, L., Nobody’s Fool: Power and Agency in Performing ‘the Blonde’ (2012) Critical Studies in Fashion & Beauty, 3 (1), pp. 131-140; Cinque, T., Values, Ideals and Power in the Brave New Digital World (2015) Communication, Digital Media and Everyday Life, pp. 184-194. , Chalkley T., Brown A., Cinque T., Warren B., Hobbs M., Finn M., (eds), 2nd ed., South Melbourne: Oxford University Press; Cinque, T., (2015); Cinque, T., Semantic Shock: David Bowie!

I will remember and recall major life events and stinging memories through his songs and performances. David Bowie has provided me with what I have elsewhere defined as the star metronome, providing me with the psychological, existential and phenomenological rhythms out of which (my) bare life emerges, blossoms and sometimes withers–its beat not linear or singular but irregular and amplified. I make sense of these wayward life stories through recall to the senses, and sensorial memory–remembering Bowie through touch, texture, sight and sound. I suggest that fan identifications such as this emerge through the interplay of three elements: affect and emotion, narratives of the self, and remembering and forgetting. Feeling, story and time produce the conditions for deeply meaningful star and fan relations to emerge. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Ahmed, S., Sociable Happiness (2008) Emotion, Space and Society, 1 (1), pp. 10-13; Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Bakhtin, M., (1993) Rabelais and His World, , Bloomington: Indiana University Press; Barad, K., (2007) Meeting the Universe Halfway, , Durham, NC: Duke University Press; Bennett, A., Subcultures or Neo-tribes?

That seems like a bizarre remark, particularly in a special issue dedicated to the opposite view. But in Latin America, he is of minimal importance by contrast with other prominent English-language pop-music exports that journal readers will know, such as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Smiths or The Cure. How can this be true of an artist who is routinely labelled a world icon? Our paper identifies several reasons: nation-building and rock music’s first steps in Latin America, progressive cultural politics, conservative gender norms and a continent dominated by dictatorships when Bowie was becoming a putative ‘world icon’. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Anderson, K., How David Bowie, Singer, Style Icon, and Eternal Chameleon, Ch-Ch-Changed Pop Culture Forever (2016) Entertainment Weekly, , http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/21/david-bowie-ew-cover-story; Barraza, F., (1972) La nueva canción Chilena, , Santiago de Chile: Quimantú; Barr-Melej, P., Hippismo a la chilena: Juventud y heterodoxia en un contexto transnacional (2009) Ampliando miradas, Chile y su historia en un tiempo global, pp. 305-326. , Purcell F., Riquelme A., (eds), Santiago: RIL Editores/Instituto de Historia PUC; Beltrán, L.R., Communication and Cultural Domination: US-Latin America Case (1978) Media Asia, 5, pp. 183-192; Boorstin, D., (1961) The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America, , New York: Vintage; Bravo, G., González, C., (2009) Ecos del tiempo subterráneo: Las peñas en Santiago durante el regimen militar (1973–1983), , Santiago de Chile: Lom; Briggs, A., Burke, P., (2003) A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet, , Cambridge: Polity Press; Bueno, G., La canonización de Marilyn Monroe (2002) El Catoblepas, 9, p. 2; Campbell, P., Bowie Bonds Blazed a Trail Through Capital Markets (2016) Financial Times, , http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad21c6e2-b851-11e5-b151-8e15c9a029fb.html#axzz45pz0DivI; Cano, N., David Bowie Soaks Up Mexican Culture in Set of Previously Unpublished Photos (2016) Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/david-bowie-mexican-culture-previously-unpublished-photos; Caso, F., Ribeiro, R.A., Tropical Glam: The Libertarian Glitter Scene in Brazil (2016) Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s, pp. 245-257. , Chapman I., Johnson H., (eds), London: Routledge; Channing, E., Bowie: Rock God or Tax Genius?

Together with a handful of other glam artists (including Roxy Music and Marc Bolan), Bowie successfully straddle the pop singles and AOR markets. Such a position enabled Bowie to explore key characteristics of glam, including its emphasis on nostalgia. Moreover, Bowie’s sophisticated understanding of glam as an ephemeral assemblage of stylistic fragments also set him apart from others in the glam rock scene. Whereas many glam artists later struggled with the legacy that glam imposed on them, Bowie’s ability to read it in a broader context of pop fads and fashions meant he could exploit the aesthetics of glam to his advantage. This article considers how Bowie tactically used glam to raise his profile as a pop icon while subsequently applying it as a conceptual blueprint for the performative identities he assumed later in his career. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Bennett, A., (2004) Remembering Woodstock, , Aldershot: Ashgate; Bennett, A., The Forgotten Decade: Rethinking the Popular Music of the 1970s (2007) Popular Music History, 2 (1), pp. 5-24; Buckley, D., (1999) Strange Fascination–David Bowie: The Definitive Story, , London: Virgin; Connolly, R., Interview with Mark Bolan (1972) Evening Standard, , http://www.rayconnolly.co.uk/pages/journalism_01/journalism_01_item.asp?journalism_01ID=85; Crossley, N., Pretty Connected: The Social Network of the Early UK Punk Movement (2008) Theory, Culture & Society, 25 (6), pp. 89-116; Dyer, R., (1986) Heavenly Bodies: Film Stars and Society, , New York: St. Martin’s Press; Fast, S., (2001) In the Houses of the Holy: Led Zeppelin and the Power of Rock Music, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Feldman-Barrett, C., Bennett, A., ‘All that Glitters’: Glam, Bricolage and the History of Post-war Youth Culture (2016) Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s, pp. 11-24. , Chapman I., Johnson H., (eds), London: Routledge; Frith, S., ‘The Magic That Can Set You Free’: The Ideology of Folk and the Myth of the Rock Community (1981) Popular Music, 1, pp. 159-168; Frith, S., (1983) Sound Effects: Youth, Leisure and the Politics of Rock, , London: Constable; Frith, S., Horne, H., (1987) Art into Pop, , London: Methuen; Gledhill, C., (1991) Stardom: Industry of Desire, , London: Routledge; Hall, S., (1996) Critical Dialogues in Cultural Studies, , London: Comedia Routledge; Hebdige, D., (1979) Subculture: The Meaning of Style, , London: Routledge; Hebdige, D., (1988) Hiding in the Light: On Images and Things, , London: Routledge; Holm-Hudson, K., (2002) Progressive Rock Reconsidered, , New York: Routledge; Hotchner, A.E., (1990) Blown Away: The Rolling Stones and the Death of the Sixties, , New York: Simon & Schuster; Laing, D., The Three Woodstocks and the Live Music Scene (2004) Remembering Woodstock, pp. 1-17. , Bennett A., (ed), Aldershot: Ashgate; Leys, C., (1983) Politics in Britain: An Introduction, , London: Verso; Macan, E., (1997) Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Mills, P., Stone Fox Chase: The Old Grey Whistle Test and the Rise of High Pop Television (2010) Popular Music and Television in Britain, pp. 55-67. , Inglis I., (ed), Farnham: Ashgate; Negus, K., (1992) Producing Pop: Culture and Conflict in the Popular Music; Redhead, S., (1990) The End-of-the-Century Party: Youth and Pop Towards 2000, , Manchester, NH: Manchester University Press; Shuker, R., (2001) Understanding Popular Music, , 2nd ed, London: Routledge; Simpson, J., (2002) Top of the Pops: 1964–2002, , London: BBC Worldwide Ltd; Stratton, J., Why Doesn’t Anybody Write Anything About Glam Rock (1986) Australian Journal of Cultural Studies, 4 (1), pp. 15-38; Taylor, I., Wall, D., Beyond the Skinheads: Comments on the Emergence and Significance of the Glamrock Cult (1976) Working Class Youth Culture, pp. 105-123. , Mungham G., Pearson G., (eds), London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Willis, P., (1978) Profane Culture, , London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Zanetta, T., Edwards, H., (1986) Stardust: The Life and Times of David Bowie, , London: Michael Joseph Ltd","Bennett, A.; Griffith UniversityAustralia; email: a.bennett@griffith.edu.au",,Routledge,10304312,,,,English,Continuum,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85022225654

In the 70s, his emergence into British popular culture at such a specifically revolutionary moment in time, locates him within the circuit of culture in a unique way, where his very being is nuanced by the processes of representation, identity, production, consumption. Through placement of his diverse personae into their cultural and socio-political contexts, it is possible to understand the cultural forces being brought to bear upon his identity; as an artist; as a musician; as a performer and as a gender-bender. The concept of regulation as part of the circuit of culture is particularly pertinent and by viewing Bowie through this lens it is possible to not only demonstrate his significance as a central figure that influenced the notion of gender as fluid rather than fixed, but also to understand how the system of cultural regulation operates to question, contain and ultimately assimilate all transgression, so as to reassert order and stability. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Anderson, E., (2013) Defensive and Inclusive Masculinities, , PhD diss, University of Bath; Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music, , Michigan: University of Michigan Press; Baudrillard, J., (1975) The Mirror of Production, , St. Louis: Telos Press; Bowie Vevo, D., (2013) David Bowie–The Stars (Are out Tonight), , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH7dMBcg-gE; Butler, J., (1990) Gender Trouble, , New York: Routledge; Butler, J., (1993) Bodies That Matter, , New York: Routledge; Chapman, I., (2015) Experiencing David Bowie: A Listener’s Companion (Routledge Studies in Popular Music), , London: Routledge; Chapman, R., Rutherford, J., (1988) Male Order: Unwrapping Masculinity, , Trowbridge: Redwood Books; Dombal, R., (2016) Blackstar, , http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21332-blackstar/; Du Gay, P., Hall, S., (1997) Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (Culture, Media and Identities series), , London: Sage; Dyer, R., (1979) Stars, , London: BFI; Edwards, T., (1997) Men in the Mirror, , New York: Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd; Edwards, T., (2006) Cultures of Masculinity, , Oxon: Routledge; (2009) David Bowie–Boys Keep Swinging, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMhFyWEMlD4, Online Video; Faludi, S., (2000) Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man, , New York: Harper Perennial; Feldman-Barrett, C., Bennett, A., All That Glitters: Glam, Bricolage and the History of Post-War Culture (2016) Global Glam and Popular Music: Style and Spectacle from the 1970s to the 2000s, pp. 11-24. , Chapman I., Johnson H., (eds), Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield; Foucault, M., (1976) The History of Sexuality: The Will to Know v.1, , London: Penguin Group; Gauntlett, D., (2008) Media, Gender and Identity: An Introduction, , London: Routledge; Glick, E., (2009) Materializing Queer Desire, , Albany, NY: SUNY Press; Gray, R., (2012) The Performance Identities of Lady Gaga: Critical Essays, , Jefferson, NC: McFarland; Hall, S., (1992) Modernity and Its Futures (the Question of Cultural Identity), , Cambridge: Polity Press; Halperin, D.M., (1995) Saint Foucault: Towards a Gay Hagiography, , Oxford: Oxford University Press; Hawkins, S., (2009) The British Pop Dandy: Masculinity, Popular Music and Culture, , London: Ashgate Publishing; Holland, S., (2004) Alternative Femininities: Body, Age and Identity, , Oxford: Berg Publishers; Howard, T., (2016) Starman!–The Story of Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust in NME, , http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/star-man-the-story-of-bowies-ziggy-stardust#fQxiCD60WwsXMR0g.99, London: Time Inc UK; Jameson, F., (1992) Postmodernism: Or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism, , London: Verso Books; Perrot, L., (2015) Bowie and Gender Transgression–What a Drag, , http://theconversation.com/bowie-and-gender-transgression-what-a-drag-44569; Stevenson, N., (2006) David Bowie: Fame, Sound and Vision, , Cambridge: Polity Celebrity Series; Thompson, K., (1997) Media and Cultural Regulation, , Milton Keynes: OUP; Trynka, P., (2011) Starman: David Bowie.

The discussion demonstrates the continuing relevance of representation as a relational concept within the circuit of culture, which can be used to make sense of Bowie as a cultural phenomenon. Bowie combines the different elements of the circuit whilst being a cultural icon heavily dependent upon the impact of image, visibility and visualization, which are central to representation. The circuit is relational and dynamic and visualization is transforming and transformative. Bowie too has reinvented himself and been re-represented, through his music and his changing images. The analysis draws upon my own experience of working in the team that developed the circuit of culture in the late 1990s to show how Bowie as a cultural figure can be understood at the intersection of the different moments in the circuit of culture, with an emphasis upon representation and visualization. A critical analysis of Bowie offers interesting insights into the relationship between the virtual and the actual as well as between production, consumption, identity and regulation and engages with key questions about the relationship between representation and lived actualities. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Ahmed, S., Bowie. the Sound, the Vision, the Genius (2016) The Guardian, p. 3. , January 12, 2016; Althusser, L., (1971) Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays, , London: New Left Books; Barthes, R., (1972) Mythologies, , London: Cape; Barthes, R., (1993) Image, Music Text, , London: Fontana Press; Baudrillard, J., (1981) Simulcra and Simulation, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Baudrillard, J., (1995) The Gulf War did not Take Place, , Bloomington: Indiana University Press; (2016), http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03djj6d; Billington, M., Great Performances: Vanessa Redgrave in as You like It (2015) The Guardian, , http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/apr/27/vanessa-redgrave-rosalind-as-you-like-it, April 27, 2015; Brixton, M., (2016), http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-35875379; Cinque, T., Moore, C., Redmond, S., (2015) Enchanting David Bowie.

The ‘killing’ of Ziggy Stardust in 1973, the passage across the silence between one side of a vinyl album and another–most notably on Low and Heroes (1977)–were all employments of the power of what was suddenly no longer there or the force of empty spaces. This essay explores Bowie’s relationship to absence by reading two texts from which he is himself absent–Henry James’s novella The Aspern Papers (1888) and Todd Haynes’s film Velvet Goldmine (1998). It argues that Aspern provides an uncanny aesthetic, sensuous and formal template for Hayne’s cinematic exploration of glam rock and its legacies. In making this argument, it explores the extents to which absence is a generative energy in James’s work and Bowie’s. Using close reading, the essay examines how the novella and the film explore questions such as affective (mis)placement in time and the relationship between absence and resistance. It also reads the role of sensuous phenomena–most notably sound, fire and colour–in making, for both texts, the past amenable to touch and visitation. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Barthes, R., (1982) Empire of Signs.

However, if we look beyond the surface and analyse Bowie’s back catalogue for patterns and trends in his songwriting methodology, we can start to see evidence of a consistent creative voice that has been present and evolving throughout. This music language uses vocal articulations, idiosyncratic approaches to melody and harmony, mode and tonality, familiar and foreign sonic landscapes and nostalgic references to encode meanings beyond the lyric and immediate pop/rock style representation. Practices and processes that lead to the creation of shared meanings are located in the communicative exchange between creator and listener, a conversation that occurs at the intersection of Production and Consumption. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Adams, C.R., Melodic Contour Typology (1976) Ethnomusicology, 20 (2), pp. 179-215; Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music, , Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; Becker, J., Becker, A., A Grammar of the Music Genre ‘Srepegan’ (1979) Journal of Music Theory, 23 (1), pp. 1-43; Bowie, D., (1995) Manuscript notes on 1.

His celebrity status is marked by a restless drive for re-creation, often in the form of ambiguously gendered personae. These personae do not simply originate from a need for constant transformation. Their life-span is connected with a complex process of performativity in which Bowie plays a pivotal role in re-animating the gestural traits of several other performers. Through an analysis of the videos for Boys Keep Swinging (1979) and The Stars (Are Out Tonight) (2013), this article explores Bowie’s role within the cycle of performativity. Complementing this analysis, the author’s interviews with New Zealand Bowie-inspired performers provide further insights about their own performativity in relation to identity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Butler, J., Performative Acts and Gender Constitution: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory (1988) Theatre Journal, 40 (4), pp. 519-531; Butler, J., (1990) Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, , New York: Routledge; Chapman, I., (2009) Glory Days: From Gumboots to Platforms, , Auckland: Harper Collins; Chapman, I., Ziggy’s Urban Alienation: Assembling the Heroic Outsider (2015) Enchanting David Bowie; Space/Time/ Body/ Memory, pp. 27-47. , Cinque T., Moore C., Redmond S., (eds), London: Bloomsbury; Clement, J., David Bowie: On Writing Flight of the Conchords’ ‘Bowie’s in Space’ (2016) The Spinoff, , http://thespinoff.co.nz/tv/13-01-2016/david-bowie-the-man-we-idolised-imitated-and-failed-to-get-on-our-show/; Crow, H., Gesturing toward Olympia (2006) Animated ‘Worlds’, pp. 49-62. , Buchan S., (ed), Eastleigh: John Libbey; D’Cruz, G., He’s not There: Velvet Goldmine and the Spectres of David Bowie (2015) Enchanting David Bowie; Space/Time/ Body/ Memory, pp. 259-273. , Cinque T., Moore C., Redmond S., (eds), London: Bloomsbury; Debord, G., Wolman, G.J., Methods of Detournement (1956) Les Levres Nues, , http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/~mma/teaching/MS80/readings/detournement.pdf; Dengler, C., Carlos Dengler on How David Bowie Gave Him the Freedom to Quit Interpol and Find Himself (2016) Pitchfork.Com, , http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/999-carlos-dengler-on-how-david-bowie-gave-him-the-freedom-to-quit-interpol-and-find-himself/; Denham, V., (2011) David Bowie: Pushing ahead of the Dame: David Bowie, Song by Song, , https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/2011/07/27/boys-keep-swinging/; Dixon, I., The Return of the Thin White Repressed: Uses of Narcissism in The Stars (Are out Tonight) (2013) Celebrity Studies, 4, pp. 397-400; Hall, S., Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices (1997) Culture, Media & Identities, , Milton Keynes/London: The Open University & Sage Publications; Jung, C.G., The Syzygy: Anima and Animus (1951) Collected Works of C.

This essay argues that productive consumption is a useful way to describe the movement of cultural commodities and their proliferation of value beyond consumption by understanding any cultural form is dependent on a co-creation of value by both the artist and the artist’s audience/consumers. In the circuit of cultural products, there is something generated that creatively transforms the product in the audience and generates at minimum new structures of value. This article explores the concept of productive consumption in terms of Bowie and his general awareness of this co-creation of value. It identifies the production of value inherent in the consumption process of Bowie through two examples: through Tribute Bands and the way that working performers retool Bowie and his music for a lived experience for a core memorializing Bowie audience; and through the performative persona of Bowie and its play with artifice as opposed to authenticity that became the source for all sorts of performance personas in popular music for more than 40 years. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,,"Arnould, E.J., Thompson, C.J., Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research (2005) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (4), pp. 868-882; Auslander, P., (2006) Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Bachlakova, P., What Does David Bowie’s Death Mean for Denmark’s only David Bowie Tribute Band (2016) Noisey Blog, , http://noisey.vice.com/en_dk/blog/what-does-david-bowies-death-mean-for-denmarks-only-david-bowie-tribute-band; Barthel, K., von Maltzahn, C.-F., Co-creation as a Process of Undoing Authenticity (2015) Critical Studies in Fashion & Beauty, 6 (2), pp. 163-185; (2016) Bowie: Obituary, , http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-12494821; Bourdieu, P., (2010) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , London: Routledge; Bowie, D., (1969) In Space Oddity: Mercury Records; (2016), http://www.bowiedownunder.com/tributes.html; Chakrabarti, A., Ramaswamy, V., Re-thinking the Concept of Surplus: Em Bracing Co-creation Experiences in Economics (2014) Journal of Economic analysis and Policy, 14 (4), pp. 1283-1297; Click, M.A., Lee, H., Holladay, H.W., Making Monsters: Lady Gaga, Fan Identification, and Social Media (2013) Popular Music and Society, 36 (3), pp. 360-379; Couldry, N., Media Meta-capital: Extending the Range of Bourdieu’s Field Theory (2003) Theory and Society, 32 (5-6), pp. 653-677. , Media meta-capital: Extending the range of; Certeau, M.D., (1984) The Practice of Everyday life, p. 229. , http://ezproxy.deakin.edu.au/login?url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5749/j.ctt5vkbhw, Berkeley: University of California Press; (2016) Tour Dates, , http://www.davidbowieworld.nl/#; Dinda, S., Social Capital in the Creation of Human Capital and Economic Growth: A Productive Consumption Approach (2008) The Journal of Socio-economics, 37 (5), pp. 2020-2033; Driessens, O., Celebrity Capital: Redefining Celebrity Using Field Theory (2013) Theory and Society, 42 (5), pp. 543-560; Du Gay, P., (1997) Production of Culture/Cultures of Production, , London: Sage in association with the Open University; Emmison, M., Bennett, T., Frow, J., (1999) Accounting for Tastes: Australian Everyday Cultures, p. 310. , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; Firat, A.F., Venkatesh, A., Liberatory Postmodernism and the Re-Enchantment of Consumption (1995) Journal of Consumer Research, 22 (3), pp. 239-267; Fiske, J., (1989) Understanding Popular Culture, , Boston, MA: Unwin Hyman; Guilbert, G.-C., (2002) Madonna as Postmodern Myth: How One Star’s Self-construction Rewrites Sex, Gender, Hollywood, and the American Dream, , Jefferson, NC: McFarland; Gregory, G., (2012) Send in the Clones: A Cultural Study of the Tribute Band, , Sheffield: Equinox Publishing; Harrick, S., Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music (2008) Theatre History Studies, p. 165; Hebdige, D., (1981) Subculture: The Meaning of Style, , London: Methuen; Huddleston, T., The Numbers Behind David Bowie’s Remarkable Career (2016) Fortune, , http://fortune.com/2016/01/11/david-bowie-career-sales/; Jenkins, H., (1992) Textual Poachers : Television Fans & Participatory Culture.

It will first provide a theoretical framework for understanding this legal category and social theory template for the outsider. In doing so, it will draw, in particular, on the work of Michel Foucault and Georges Canguilhem, work which understands the monster in terms of a double breach, of nature and law. However, the article will supplement Foucault and Canguilhem’s theoretical and historical observations with a recognition of the monster’s intrinsic hopefulness - it guarantees us a future and points to the place of the sacred. Through Bowie, we will journey through the territory of sex, gender and sexuality, human/animal hybridity, and the sacred and profane and, in the process, consider some key categorical distinctions that the monster brings to crisis. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",David Bowie; gender; hope; human/animal hybridity; monsters; sacred/profane; sexuality,,"Critchley, S., (2014) Bowie, 38p. , OR Books; Foucault, M., (2003) Abnormal: Lectures at the College De France 1974-1975, 66p. , Verso; Canguilhem, G., (1964) Monstrosity and the Monstrous, 40p; Rai, A.S., (2004) Of Monsters: Biopower, Terrorism and Excess in Genealogies of Monstrosity, 18 (4); Carroll, N., (1990) The Philosophy of Horror: Paradoxes of the Heart, , Routledge; Shildrick, M., (2002) Embodying the Monster: Encounters with the Vulnerable Self, , Sage; Creed, B., (1993) The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, , Feminism, Psychoanalysis (Routledge; Foucault, M., (1977) Discipline and Punish: The Birth of The Prison, , Penguin; Cohen, J.J., Monster Culture: Seven Theses (1996) Monster Theory: Reading Culture, 6p. , in JJ Cohen, (University of Minnesota Press; Foucault, M., (1980) Herculine Barbin: Being the Recently Discovered Memoirs of a Nineteenth Century French Hermaphrodite, , Pantheon Books; Epstein, J., (1995) Altered Conditions: Disease, Medicine, and Storytelling, 19p. , (Routledge; Daston, L., (1991) Marvelous Facts and Miraculous Evidence in Early Modern Europe, 18p; Durkheim, E., (1965) The Elementary Forms of Religious Life; Manderson, D., (2006) Leftovers: The End of Private Law, 29, pp. 23-144; Bataille, G., (1986) Eroticism: Death and Sensuality, , City Lights Books; Mirdamadi, Y., The Plurality of the Sacred—Critical Remarks on Mircea Eliades Conception of the Sacred’ (2015) Open Journal of Philosophy, 5, pp. 397-402; Attali, J., (1985) Noise: The Political Economy of Music, 11p. , University of Minnesota Press; Hunt, K.J., The Eyes of David Bowie (2015) T Cinque, C Moore and S Redmond, pp. 175-195. , (eds), Enchanting David Bowie: Space, Time, Body, Memory (Bloomsbury; Brooker, W., (2013) Look Back at that Man: David Bowie in Retrospect, 4 (3), pp. 390-392; Freud, S., The Uncanny; Nietzsche, F., (1974) Thus Spoke Zarathustra, , Penguin; Stark, T., Confronting Bowies Mysterious Corpses’, pp. 61-78. , in Cinque; Kimmelman, M., (1998) David Bowie on His Favorite Artists, , interview with David Bowie, New York Times, 14; Trynka, P., (2011) David Bowie—The Definitive Biography, , Machete Digital; Fitch, R., In This Age of Grand Allusion: Bowie, Nihilism and Meaning’, pp. 19-34. , in Devereux; Fitch, R., In This Age of Grand Allusion: Bowie, Nihilism and Meaning’, 26p. , in Devereux; Buckley, D., (2010) Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story, 102p. , (Virgin Publishing; Pegg, N., (2002) The Complete David Bowie, 232p. , Reynolds & Hearn; Butler, J., (1993) Bodies that Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex, , Routledge; Watts, M., (1972) Oh You Pretty Things, , interview with David Bowie, Melody Maker; Savage, J., (1980) ‘David Bowie: Gender Bender, , The Face; Oppenheim, M., (2016) David Bowie: How the Glam Rock Artist Became an LGBT Icon, , www.independent.co.uk/news/people/how-david-bowiebecame-a-gay-icon-a6806041.html, The Independent, 11 January; Kohn, S., David Bowies Mind-Blowing Queer Legacy’ (2016) Refinery, 11p; Dollimore, J., (1987) Different Desires: Subjectivity and Transgression in Wilde and Gide, 1 (1); Redmond, S., (2013) Who am I Now?

Music papers and Bowie had substantial cultural power: Bowie was a rising star and music papers recruited journalists who discussed and perpetuated social change. The subsequent conversation, however, reinforced negative stereotypes in constructing the queer subject and tried to safeguard commercial concerns due to the assumption that the market for popular music avoided queer music.

However, whist O’Neill and McHugh and Roy and Manley are social scientists collaborating with arts professionals, Eloise Malone reports on a project led by a small arts organisation working collaboratively with a children’s charity on a project exploring the lived experience of Child Sexual Exploitation.The very title of Malone’s article makes immediate use of the power of the visual image that we foreground in this Special Edition. From the start we expect truth to be cold, art to be a fulcrum, there will be considerations of recovery, participation, change. The article does not disappoint as it conveys work with and by vulnerable young men and women aged 15-18 with experience of child sexual exploitation (CSE). The article describes how ‘high culture’ can be understood and made accessible to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals and groups (much as the recently-deceased David Bowie achieved to such widespread and memorable effect). The young people involved in this work were taken to see works of Art in various galleries and were given some training as artists and curators. Key ideas were established by way of non-linear methods which included play, games, creativity and social dreaming. This process culminated in the creation of a ‘mausoleum’ of glass-cast and ice-cast children’s shoes which slowly fell to pieces throughout each day in the gallery. Coming from an arts background Malone is especially interested in the transformative power of the art object itself–as well as the accompanying process of involvement in its production. Her central argument is that it is the quality of the art work or curating produced by the young people in these socially engaged arts processes that matters in the sense that it created not only a ‘third’ through which to think about their experience, but a third with form and quality which in itself communicates something that is distinctive but can be shared. It is this that creates the opportunity for social and civic change through public engagement. This emerges because high quality artistic expression elicits an empathic response from the audience, creating an immediate strong reaction, and a lasting resonance. Malone acknowledges that creation is a necessary but insufficient condition in achieving change. The transformative power of an art object is described in language for ‘non-arts specialists’ that enables them to appreciate the quality of a created arts object. Those viewing the work were given wired headsets which provided a looped soundtrack to the show. This device thus made use of (also) transitory and yet repeated sound as a means of accentuating what the audience were seeing. The work was arranged so that those viewing it did so by walking over text written on the floor. The shoes the audience were looking at were melting before their eyes while their own shoes remained intact and ‘walked over’ important information. Plinths were arranged to emulate a war cemetery and lighting was carefully employed to accentuate the effect. Freud’s concept of ‘The Uncanny’ and Jung’s writing on archetypes are applied to the work. This is a powerful piece which shows how careful thinking behind conceptual art can produce a visual response to a topic which resonates more forcefully than ‘a thousand words’. The young people involved in the project are shown to have benefitted from doing so. One person viewing the work is quoted as saying, “I can’t remember the time art moved me as much as The Cold Truth: powerful, heart-breaking, and real.” If the impact of work described here were more widely appreciated or understood by commissioners–the implication might be making fuller use of artist and curators in services for children and young people. © 2017 GAPS.",,,,,,Routledge,02650533,,,,English,J.

Drawing upon the concept of reification, it is argued that the notion of celebrity is discursively (re)produced and configured through a ‘public face’ that is defined, maintained and shaped via media reports and public responses that aim to know and reflect upon celebrity. The findings highlight how Bowie’s reification was supported by discourses that represented him as an observable, reified form. Here, Bowie’s ‘reality’, that is, his authentic/veridical self, was obscured behind a façade of mediation, interpretation and representation that debated and decided his ‘authenticity’ as a cultural icon. Such debates, however, were engagements with a reified image, enveloped in continual (re)interpretation. As a result, Bowie’s reification was grounded in a polysemous process that allowed numerous versions of ‘himself’ to be aesthetically reimagined, reinvented and repeated. © 2016 University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.",audience; authenticity; celebrity; Celebrity death; David Bowie; fan; Lukács; media and communications; public; Reification,,"Adams, C., (2016), Ziggy’s last stand.

Like many disciplines, however, historiographical studies have been subjected to critiques of various theoretical and imaginative types, particularly, but not exclusively, in recent times. These critiques are outlined here, and three historiographical models critically applied to the understanding of Mahler's music: historicism, historical materialism (after Walter Benjamin), and a more radical rhizomatic model (after Deleuze). Posited, put into operation and questioned, these models cast multi-perspectival and multi-temporal light on how Mahler's music continues to participate in contexts of contemporary mass-media and public consciousness. © Oxford University Press 2017.

The interview tracks the impact of his move from his native Dublin to Cork and his involvement with the theatre company Corcadorca. It also explores the personal origins of his family of characters, his recurrent themes, and the impulses behind his enigmatic but highly successful play Ballyturk. Walsh’s approach to working with actors (especially Mikel Murfi and Cillian Murphy), to directing his own work, and to audiences is probed in some detail. Finally he discusses his attitude towards his own Irishness and the evolution of his creative processes as a playwright. © The Author(s) 2017.",Corcadorca; Creative process; Directing; Disco pigs; Enda walsh; International playwright; Musical; Opera,,,"FitzGibbon, G.; University College CorkIreland; email: G.Fitzgibbon@ucc.ie",,Palgrave Macmillan,,9783319597102; 9783319597096,,,English,Perspectives on Contemporary Ir.

In addition to grieving messages, however, celebrities’ posthumous SNS increasingly include promotional content; late celebrities, from Marilyn Monroe to David Bowie, regularly tweet or post promotional messages from the afterlife. The aim of this paper is to explore consumer attitudes toward marketing communication in a posthumous environment. Prior research has consistently documented consumers’ rejection of marketing activities in other sacred environments. By investigating the interaction effect of celebrity attachment (fans vs. non-fans) and death salience on celebrities’ posthumous SNS, this research is the first to identify a positive response to marketing communication in a sacred environment. Three experimental studies demonstrate that although both fans and non-fans react negatively to promotional messages when death is salient, over time, celebrity attachment diminishes death salience and fosters a positive response of fans toward promotional messages on celebrities’ posthumous SNS. Celebrity attachment may favor artificial immortality and, as such, distance the late celebrity from death-related thoughts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Celebrity attachment; Communication; Death salience; Sacredness; Social networking sites,,"Alexander, J.C., The celebrity-icon (2010) Cultural Sociology, 4 (3), pp. 323-336; Baker, S.M., Kennedy, P.F., Death by nostalgia: A diagnosis of context-specific cases (1994) NA-advances in consumer research, 21; Belk, R.W., Wallendorf, M., Sherry, J.F., Jr., The sacred and the profane in consumer behavior: Theodicy on the odyssey (1989) Journal of Consumer Research, 16 (1), pp. 1-38; Brandes, L., Nüesch, S., Franck, E., Death-related publicity as informational advertising: Evidence from the music industry (2016) Marketing Letters, 27 (1), pp. 143-157; Brown, S., Kozinets, R.V., Sherry, J.F., Jr., Teaching old brands new tricks: Retro branding and the revival of brand meaning (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67 (3), pp. 19-33; Brown, W.J., Basil, M.D., Bocarnea, M.C., The influence of famous athletes on health beliefs and practices: Mark McGwire, child abuse prevention, and androstenedione (2003) Journal of Health Communication, 8 (1), pp. 41-57; Brubaker, J.R., Hayes, G.R., Dourish, P., Beyond the grave: Facebook as a site for the expansion of death and mourning (2013) The Information Society, 29 (3), pp. 152-163; Burke, B.L., Martens, A., Faucher, E.H., Two decades of terror management theory: A meta-analysis of mortality salience research (2010) Personality and Social Psychology Review, 14 (2), pp. 155-195; Chartrand, T.L., Huber, J., Shiv, B., Tanner, R.J., Nonconscious goals and consumer choice (2008) Journal of Consumer Research, 35 (2), pp. 189-201; Choi, S.M., Rifon, N.J., It is a match: The impact of congruence between celebrity image and consumer ideal self on endorsement effectiveness (2012) Psychology and Marketing, 29, pp. 639-650; Church, S.H., Digital gravescapes: Digital memorializing on Facebook (2013) The Information Society, 29, pp. 184-189; Curasi, C.F., Price, L.L., Arnould, E.J., How individuals’ cherished possessions become families’ inalienable wealth (2004) Journal of Consumer Research, 31 (3), pp. 609-622; Drake, P., Miah, A., The cultural politics of celebrity (2010) Cultural Politics, 6 (1), pp. 49-64; D'Rozario, D., Dead celebrity (Deleb) use in marketing: An initial theoretical exposition (2016) Psychology and Marketing, 33 (7), pp. 486-504; Eagar, T., Lindridge, A., (2014), Becoming iconic: David Bowie from man to icon.

But to date very little research has been conducted on how madness is represented in popular music. In an effort to redress this imbalance, Nicola Spelman identifies links between the anti-psychiatry movement and representations of madness in popular music of the 1960s and 1970s, analysing the various ways in which ideas critical of institutional psychiatry are embodied both verbally and musically in specific songs by David Bowie, Lou Reed, Pink Floyd, Alice Cooper, The Beatles, and Elton John. She concentrates on meanings that may be made at the point of reception as a consequence of ideas about madness that were circulating at the time. These ideas are then linked to contemporary conventions of musical expression in order to illustrate certain interpretative possibilities. Supporting evidence comes from popular musicological analysis - incorporating discourse analysis and social semiotics - and investigation of socio-historical context. The uniqueness of the period in question is demonstrated by means of a more generalised overview of songs drawn from a variety of styles and eras that engage with the topic of madness in diverse and often conflicting ways. The conclusions drawn reveal the extent to which anti-psychiatric ideas filtered through into popular culture, offering insights into popular music's ability to question general suppositions about madness alongside its potential to bring issues of men's madness into the public arena as an often neglected topic for discussion. © Nicola Spelman 2012 All rights reserved.",,,"Adame, A., Hornstein, G., Representing Madness: How Are Subjective Experiences of Emotional Distress Presented in First-Person Accounts?

Focus is given to a number of representative artists, bands, and movements, as well as national, regional, and cultural contexts from around the globe. Approaching glam music performance and style broadly, and using the glam/glitter rock genre of the early 1970s as a foundation for case studies and comparisons, the volume engages with subjects that help in defining the glam phenomenon in its many manifestations and contexts. Glam rock, in its original, term-defining inception, had its birth in the UK in 1970/71, and featured at its forefront acts such as David Bowie, T. Rex, Slade, and Roxy Music. Termed ""glitter rock"" in the US, stateside artists included Alice Cooper, Suzi Quatro, The New York Dolls, and Kiss. In a global context, glam is represented in many other cultures, where the influences of early glam rock can be seen clearly. In this book, glam exists at the intersections of glam rock and other styles (e.g., punk, metal, disco, goth). Its performers are characterized by their flamboyant and theatrical appearance (clothes, costumes, makeup, hairstyles), they often challenge gender stereotypes and sexuality (androgyny), and they create spectacle in popular music performance, fandom, and fashion. The essays in this collection comprise theoretically-informed contributions that address the diversity of the world�s popular music via artists, bands, and movements, with special attention given to the ways glam has been influential not only as a music genre, but also in fashion, design, and other visual culture. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

This article argues that the tropological nature of these death poems constitutes a genre in and of itself and shows a break from the tradition of Danish commemorative poetry going back to the seventeenth century and the Baroque poet Thomas Kingo. What is so alluring about the death-poems written for Strunge is that the focus shifts from a static portrait of the individual to a personal individualizing of the poet and his fate. Another shift crystallized by this phenomenon is that many of the poems for Strunge were by writers who had never met the poet yet were still able to instill a deep sense of intimacy in their verse. By reading themselves into the fabric of Strunge's own verse, these death-poems changed the fabric of commemorative poetry in the Danish language. The article also pays attention to Strunge's fascination with David Bowie and marks an interesting analogy in the very recent phenomenon of 'Bowietry,' cut-up poetry written for the death of David Bowie and constructed from his own words.",Danish poetry; David Bowie; Death-poem (dodedigtning); Michael strunge; Paul de man; Poetry of the eighties (firserlyrikken),,"Auken, S., (1998) Eftermcele: En Studie I Den Danske Dededigtning Fra Anders Arrebo Til Soren Ulrik Thomsen, , Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanums Forlag; Caws, M.A., Luckhurst, N., (2008) The Reception of Virginia Woolfin Europe, , London: Continuum; De Man, P., (1993) Romanticism and Contemporary Criticism: The Gauss Seminar and other Papers, , Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press; De Man, P., (1984) The Rhetoric of Romanticism, , New York: Columbia University Press; Grotrian, S., (1993) Livsfcelder, , Copenhagen: Borgen; Barlyng, M., Lucas, I., Handesten, L., Zerlang, M., Svendsen, E., (2007) Dansk Litteraturs Historie, Bind 5: 1960-2000, , eds.) .

A recent study conducted by Sharman and Dingle (2015) supports the view that therapeutic potential of music in the rock genre goes against the commonly accepted ideal that heavy music typified in rock acts as catalysts for negative emotions, such as general anxiety or aggression. Bowie’s penchant for reflecting the world around him-as encompassed especially in the lyrical content of the song and it’s subsequent music video that showcases a 10 minute runtime and breathtaking visuals-is the key element of why music is not only vital as a human-created art form, but a critical venue wherein the existentialist can mirror his or her world and inspire the layperson to do the same. That echoing of the human situation through art, I suggest, is precisely what Camus meant about remaining present with the absurdity of life and utilizing an alchemical container like a song to channel the resultant anxiety derived from understanding that absurdity, and transforming that anxiety into a feeling of serenity, and even possibly delight. © 2016, E-FLOW PDF NeuroQuantology.

Groups such as Can, Popol Vuh, Faust, and Tangerine Dream arose out of the German student movement of 1968 and connected leftist political activism with experimental rock music and, later, electronic sounds. Since the 1970s, American and British popular genres such as indie, post-rock, techno, and hip hop have drawn heavily on krautrock, ironically reversing a flow of influence krautrock originally set out to disrupt. Among other topics, individual chapters of the book focus on the redefinition of German identity in the music of Kraftwerk, Can, and Neu!; on community and conflict in the music of Amon Düül, Faust, and Ton Steine Scherben; on ""cosmic music"" and New Age; and on Donna Summer's and David Bowie's connections to Germany. Rather than providing a purely musicological or historical account, Krautrock discusses the music as being constructed through performance and articulated through various forms of expressive culture, including communal living, spirituality, and sound. © 2016 by Ulrich Adelt.

The empowered capacity of mobile devices and their growing adoption in our everyday life is generating an enormous increment in the production of personal data such as calls, positioning, online purchases and even music listening. Musical listening is a type of data that has started receiving more attention from the scientific community as consequence of the increasing availability of rich and punctual online data sources. Starting from the listening of 30k Last.Fm users, we show how the employment of the Personal Listening Data Models can provide higher levels of self-awareness. In addition, the proposed model will enable the development of a wide range of analysis and musical services both at personal and at collective level. � Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",,Application programs; Computation theory; Formal methods; Software engineering; Verification; Last.fm; Online data sources; Scientific community; Self awareness; Audio acoustics,"Abiteboul, S., R�, B., Kaplan, D., Managing your digital life (2015) Commun.

Stacey J.,14828325800;,Crossing over with Tilda Swinton—the Mistress of “Flat Affect”,2015,"International Journal of Politics, Culture and Society",28,3,,243,271,,9,10.1007/s10767-014-9193-8,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84939265405&doi=10.1007%2fs10767-014-9193-8&partnerID=40&md5=a474ffd47e9aa7e63e2465ac60669221,"The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom","Stacey, J., The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom","Tilda Swinton is hard to classify as a performer because flux and mutability have become her signature qualities. One enduring element in her repertoire, however, can be brought into focus through Lauren Berlant’s concept of “flat affect.” Typically described as mysterious, otherworldly, or ethereal, Swinton often brings to her screen and live performances a quality or atmosphere that contradicts the conventional expectations of feminine emotional expressiveness and legibility in popular cinema. As a contribution to this special issue on Berlant’s work, my article traces Swinton’s styles of flat affect as an aesthetic relationality across a number of films, including Teknolust, Michael Clayton, The Deep End, and Orlando. My reading of Swinton’s capacity for flatness places it within the history of her unusual facility to cross between independent and more popular cultural forms and to set femininity as genre in motion as she does so. Famous for embodying gender ambiguity since her performance as Orlando, Swinton’s association with androgyny as a pre-queer promise of limitlessness folds femininity back upon its historical conventions and imperatives. In tracing the history of Swinton’s gender fluctuations, this article concludes by reflecting on some of the failures of feminist and queer language to articulate the nuances of affective registers; androgyne, butch, tomboy, trans, and genderqueer designate styles of gendered and sexual embodiment, but these do not extend satisfactorily to aesthetic moods and atmospheres. Closing with a discussion of “offgender” flux, the article considers Swinton’s recent twinning with David Bowie to open up how her performances reinvent affective genres while calling forth their histories and temporalities. © 2015, The Author(s).",Feminist and queer theory; Flat affect; Gender and genre; Lauren Berlant; Tilda Swinton,,"Alaimo, S., Hekman, S., (2008) Material feminisms, , (eds), Indiana University Press, Bloomington; Angerer, M.-L., (2014) Desire after affect, , Rowman & Littlefield International, London: forthcoming; Barthes, R., (1973) Mythologies, , Paladin Grafton Books, London; Berlant, L., (1991) The anatomy of national fantasy: Hawthorne, utopia, and everyday life, , University of Chicago Press, Chicago; Berlant, L., The queen of America goes to Washington city: essays on sex and citizenship (1997) Durham: Duke University Press; Berlant, L., The subject of true feeling: pain, privacy and politics (2000) Transformations: thinking through feminism, pp. 33-47. , Sara A, (ed), Routledge, London; Berlant, L., Thinking about feeling historical (2008) Emotion, Space and Society, 1 (1), pp. 4-9; Berlant, L., (2008) The female complaint: the unfinished business of sentimentality in American culture, , Duke University Press, Durham; Berlant, L., (2011) Cruel optimism, , Duke University Press, Durham; Berlant, L., Structures of unfeeling: mysterious skin.

This interdisciplinary book brings together established and emerging scholars from a wide variety of backgrounds, including musicology, sociology, art history, literary theory, philosophy, politics, film studies and media studies. Bowie's complexity as a singer, songwriter, producer, performer, actor and artist demands that any critical engagement with his overall work must be interdisciplinary and wide-ranging in its scope. The chapters are organised around the key themes of 'textualities', 'psychologies', 'orientalisms', 'art and agency' and 'performing and influencing' in Bowie's work. This comprehensive book contributes a great deal to the study of popular music, performance, gender, religion, popular media and celebrity. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Market-generated materials covering Bowie’s fifty year career were analysed using structuration theory. Our findings indicate that Bowie’s control of his human brand was increasingly determined by differing agents within the market. We conclude that a celebrity’s human brand is as much a creation of the market, as it is the celebrity’s. Yet unlike the celebrity, their character’s ongoing popularity reflects not only a moment in time but also an ability to adapt to differing times. © 2015, © 2015 Westburn Publishers Ltd.",branding; celebrity; David Bowie; Human brands; structuration,,"(1974) The Dick Cavett Show, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8TnXRBkYt8, November; Arsel, Z., Bean, J., Taste regimes and market-mediated practice (2013) Journal of Consumer Research, 39 (5), pp. 899-917. , http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/666595; Auslander, P., Performance analysis and popular music: A Manifesto (2004) Contemporary Theatre Review, 14 (1), pp. 1-13; Auslander, P., Musical personae (2006) TDR/The Drama Review, 50 (1), pp. 100-119. , www.jstor.org/stable/4492661; (1972) Ziggy Stardust news article on Nationwide, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jNfjTxGWs, May; (1975) ‘Cracked Actor’ Arena program, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoAKGTeKlZs; (1983) Nationwide, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqiTgApODBk; Beaumont, M., The nine lives of Trent Raznor (2013) The Guardian., , http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/08/the-nine-lives-of-trent-reznor, August; Boorstin, D.J., (1964) The image: A guide to pseudo-events in America, , New York, NY: Harper and Row; Bowie, D., (1984) Blue Jean, , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXvAaNcXNzI; Brown, S., Hackley, C., The greatest showman on Earth: Is Simon Cowell P.T.

These descriptions of New York sex in the periods before and after AIDS consist of text, drawings, and photographs, including information on drug taking, numerous clubs (the Mineshaft was one of Bowie's haunts), a great amount of casual sex, and material dealing with the New York fisting scene. They are not philosophical or romantic reminiscences but sex diaries. The article deals with both a described sexual world and the source that represents it. The diaries are a chronicle. But they are also sexual objects, Bowie's own sexual archive. He was aroused both by the memories they stored and his textual and visual renderings. He refers to masturbating to his drawings—even while executing them. The archive is imbricated in its recorded sexual encounters in intriguing ways. © 2015 by MARHO: The Radical Historians’ Organization, Inc.",AIDS; Fisting; Mineshaft; New York; Sex,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Library, , Manuscripts and Archives Division, David Louis Bowie Diaries, 1978 – 1993 (hereafter Bowie Diaries).

However, one of the archivists provided me with the donor’s contact details, and I approached him for special permission to consult them, which was granted without reservation (“As a matter of fact, this is exactly the reason I made the effort to get them into the possession of the New York Public Library” [Richard Schaneman, e-mail message to author, June 8, 2010]).

We address the research question of how are contradictions between celebrity and iconicity resolved in creating and managing a human brand. Methodology/approach-Using structuration theory, we analyzed David Bowie's 50 year career, from 1964 to 2013, totaling 562 documents. Applying Langley's (1999) stages of data collection of grounding, organizing, and replicating, we develop a process of model of celebrity and iconicity. Findings-We identify three stages of human brand symbolic associations: forming, fixing, and transitioning associations. These represent alternate trajectories that Bowie and Ziggy Stardust followed to become icons. In resolving his trajectories across these stages, Bowie adapts and adopts commercial materials, business practices, and new technologies to converge his symbolic associations into a coherent iconic human brand. Research limitations/implications-Limitations of this paper lie in focusing on one human brand in a particular industry. Future research is suggested in three areas: (1) the relationship between the proposed model and other human brand activities; (2) to explore how the process is manipulated by other market agents; and (3) whether a human brand's association shifts can precede culture. Originality/value-This perspective challenges existing conceptualizations of celebrity and iconicity by framing them as inter-related processes, where celebrity associations are fixed in time, while iconic associations transition across time periods to reflect changing cultural values and concerns. © 2015 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Brand icons; celebrity; David Bowie; Human brands; Iconicity; Structuration theory,,"Alexander, J.C., The celebrity-icon (2010) Cultural Sociology, 4 (3), pp. 323-336; Auslander, P., Performance analysis and popular music: A manifesto (2004) Contemporary Theatre Review, 14 (1), pp. 1-13; Auslander, P., Musical persona (2006) The Drama Review, 50 (1), pp. 100-119; Baudrillard, J., (1994) Simulacra and Simulation, , [1981] Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press; BBC., (1972) Nationwide, , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JADEBKhCF4, June 5); Boorstin, D.J., (1964) The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-events in America, , New York, NY: Harper & Row; Bourdieu, P., (1984) Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste, , [1979]) Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press; Brown, S., Kozinets, R.V., Sherry, J.F., Jr., Teaching old brands new tricks: Retro branding and the revival of brand meaning (2003) Journal of Marketing, 67 (3), pp. 19-33; Brown, S., McDonagh, P., Shultz, I.I.C.J., Titanic: Consuming the myths and meanings of an ambiguous brand (2013) Journal of Consumer Research, 40 (4), pp. 595-614; Crowe, C., (1976) Bowie Golden Years, , http://please-killme.com/david-bowie-playboy-interview-1976/, Playboy, September; Debord, G., (2002) The Society of the Spectacle, , Canberra: Hobgoblin Press; Edwards, H., (1972) The Rise of Ziggy Stardust, , http://exploringdavidbowie.com/2013/02/13/the-rise-of-ziggy-stardust/, After Dark, October; (2013) Bowie: ""fame Can Take Interesting Men and Thrust Mediocrity Upon Them."", , http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/music/3938/bowie-what-ive-learned/, Esquire.

Less obvious is the way in which she uses animation and gesture to estrange the movement of performing bodies. While pixilation and stop motion animation are used together to invert the agency of humans and objects, Sigismondis use of gesture extends this manipulation of agency beyond technical processes. This dialectic of cinematic agency is discussed through an examination of three music videos directed by Sigismondi: End of the World (2004) for The Cure, Montauk Fling (2013) for Lawrence Rothman and The Stars (Are Out Tonight) (2013) for David Bowie. Considering these videos in relation to puppet animation, live-action film and the cultural and historical migration of gesture, the author argues that Sigismondi puppetises humans and animates gesture as a means of transgression. © The Author(s) 2015.",Animation; embodiment; Floria Sigismondi; gesture; human pixilation; music video; puppet animation; transgression; uncanny,,"Auerbach, J., (2007) Body Shots: Early Cinemas Incarnations, , Berkeley: University of California Press; Baker, J., Photographys expanded field (2005) October, 114 (FALL), pp. 120-140; Baron, S., Carnicke, S.M., (2008) Reframing Screen Performance, , Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Bell, J., Playing with the eternal uncanny: The persistent life of lifeless objects (2014) The Routledge Companion to Puppetry and Material Performance, pp. 43-52. , Posner DN.

Montagna, 31, Cosenza, 87100, Italy","Roger Keith “Syd” Barrett (Cambridge, January 6, 1946 - Cambridge, July 7, 2006) was a British singer, guitarist, composer and painter, founder and leader of Pink Floyd from 1965 to 1968, when he left the group. Before retiring to private life, he recorded two solo albums, “The Madcap Laughs” and “Barrett”, published in 1970. His experience and skills strongly influenced the subsequent production of the group, especially albums like “Dark Side of the Moon”, “Wish You Were Here” and “The Wall”. The innovative guitar style of Barrett and his propensity to exploration of new experimental techniques, like the use of dissonance, distortion and feedback, had an enormous impact on several musicians, from David Bowie to Brian Eno to Jimmy Page. After his retirement, Barrett led a secluded life painting and devoted to gardening, completely ignoring all the popularity and by losing his own tracks fueling even more his legend. A series of biographies were written about him since the eighties. In any case, the Pink Floyd composed and recorded several musical tributes dedicated to him after his departure from the band. The use of synthetic drugs of any kind and social withdrawal fostered the clinical impression that Barrett was suffering from schizophrenia. Recent studies, however, would suggest the hypothesis that he was suffering from a low-functioning Asperger’s syndrome. The aim of this paper is to review Barrett’s data that would indicate that this was actually his diagnosis. © 2015 Giovanni Fioriti Editore s.r.l.",Asperger’s syndrome; Pink Floyd; Schizophrenia; Syd Barrett,cannabis; mandrax; anxiety; Article; Asperger syndrome; behavior assessment; behavior disorder; case report; depression; disease assessment; DSM-5; human; literature; psychiatric treatment; psychosis; psychosocial disorder; public figure; schizophrenia,"(2013) Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition DSM-V, , American Psychiatric Publishing, Washington D.C./London; Asher, J.E., Lamb, J.A., Brocklebank, D., Cazier, J.B., Maestrini, E., Addis, L., Sen, M., Monaco, A.P., A Whole-Genome Scan and Fine-Mapping Linkage Study of Auditory-Visual Synesthesia Reveals Evidence of Linkage to Chromosomes 2q24, 5q33, 6p12, and 12p12 (2009) American Journal of Human Genetics, 84 (2), pp. 279-285; Blake, M., (2007) Pigs might fly: The inside story of Pink Floyd, , Aurum Press, UK; Chapman, R., Tictmarsh, A., (2010) Syd Barrett: A Very Irregular Head, , Faber & Faber, UK; Fusar-Poli, P., Roger Keith ""Syd"" Barrett (1946-2006) (2007) The American Journal of Psychiatry, 164 (7), p. 1028; (2015) MLA Style ""Syd Barrett"", , Bio.

Beginning with a case anecdote about an amphetamine user who was troubled with an underlying psychotic condition, and much taken with David Bowie’s song Space Oddity, the case draws attention to the emptiness in which the client's social relations were conducted. Bion's thoughts on the challenge of linking drug addiction and psychosis are refracted in his personal copy of Rosenfeld’s (1965) book Psychotic States, where Bion made copious notes in the margins and coined the term ‘concentration for annihilation’. Some of these notes throw new light on Bion's approach to working with psychotic fixation which he derived from working with clients using drugs as well as those who were suffering psychotic states. Particular attention is given to one of Bion’s clients whose repetition-compulsion appeared to create what we might think of as a ‘psychotic vacuum’. In the final case study the life and death of Lucy Cameron is cause for reflection. Lucy’s poem ‘The Space’ draws attention to the devastating psychotic vacuum created by substance misuse. © 2014 The Association for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in the NHS.",drug addiction; fixation; psychosis; psychotherapy; repetition-compulsion; substance misuse,,"Bion, W.R., (1967) Second thoughts, , London: Maresfield Press; Bion, W.R., (1997) War memoirs 1917–1919, , London: Karnac Books; Breggin, P., (1991) Toxic psychiatry, , New York, NY: St Martin's Press; Cameron, L., (2009) Rubbish up the Messheads, , London: Squiffy Books; Connell, P.H., The use and abuse of amphetamines (1968) The Practitioner, 200, pp. 234-243; Freud, S., Civilization and its discontents (1930) The Standard Edition of the complete psychological works of Sigmund Freud, Volume 21, , Strachey J., (ed), (1975), London: Vintage; Hornik, R., Jacobsohn, L., Orwin, R., Piesse, A., Kalton, G., Effects of the national youth anti-drug media campaign on youths (2008) American Journal of Public Health, 98, pp. 2229-2236; Khantzian, E., Albanese, M.J., (2008) Addiction as self medication, , Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield; Laing, A., (1994) R D Laing: A biography, , London: Peter Owen; Lasch, C., (1977) The culture of Narcissism, , New York, NY: W.W.

Directed by Ivo van Hove, this is also a production for which every note of music and every recorded sound is taken from David Bowies work. Using interviews with Ivo van Hove and other members of TGA, this article explores the relationships of support, mutual excavation and surprise between this production of Kushners plays by Hollands leading theatre company and David Bowies music. It does so with an emphasis on floating as a lyrical, scenographic and ontological state. And in the process it covers topics such as the relationships of Bowies lyrics to Kushners text, autobiographys presence in theatre, the impact of white light, and vinyl LPs. © 2014 Taylor and Francis.",,,"I am very grateful to Roeland Fernhout, Hans Kesting,Wim Selles, and IvoVan Hove for agreeing to be interviewed; I thank the following for their generosity with their time, their willingness to read, to listen, and to help; Barry Atsma, Steve Bottoms, Colin Dayan, Joe Collier, Annick Fransen, Marieke Heebink, Jonathan Hope,Marlene Kenens, and Jared Seth and John Turgoose; Angels in America is an overarching title for two plays, Millennium Approaches and Perestroika; For reasons that will become clear as this essay goes on; I refer to Millennium Approaches as 'Part One' and to Perestroika as 'Part Two'; Various productions have accentuated the prominence both plays give tomusic and sound; Freya Edward's apocalyptic sound design for Declan Donellan's 1993 National Theatre production in London; The endless white noise and radio feedback of Lee Bagley's 2003Unity Theatre production in Liverpool; Silken Thomas Players's 2011 Version, , More recently performed at Dublin's Peacock Theatre, drew on the work of composers such as Michael Nyman and Thomas Newman; Eva Dahlman's 2011 production at Stockholm's Stadtsteater combined; An Angel's voice of brainslicing terror with music by figures such as Chic, Madonna, Patti Smith, and Jimi Hendrix; Kushner, T., (2007) Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes.

Whether working with talking dolls in a homemade short (Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story) or with Oscar-winning performers inan HBO miniseries (Mildred Pierce), Haynes has garnered numerous awards and nominations and an expanding fan base for his provocative and engaging work. In all his films, Haynes works to portray the struggles of characters in conflict with the norms of society. Many of his movies focus on female characters, drawing inspiration from genres such as the woman's film and the disease movie (Far from Heaven and Safe); others explore male characters who transgress sexual and other social conventions (Poison and Velvet Goldmine). The writer-director has drawn on figures such as Karen Carpenter, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, and Bob Dylan in his meditations on American and British music, celebrity, and the meaning of identity. His 2007 movie I'm Not There won a number of awards and was notable for Haynes's decision to cast six different actors (one of whom was a woman) to portray Dylan. Gathering interviews from 1989 through 2012, this collection presents a range of themes, films, and moments in the burgeoning career of Todd Haynes. © 2014 by University Press of Mississippi.",,,,,,University Press of Mississippi,,9781626740211; 9781617039836,,,English,Todd Haynes: Interviews,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949310046

Since construction completion, last year was very special for Canada, for many reasons including the first Canadian ISS Commander, Chris Hadfield who filled the role between March and May 2013. Records of ISS utilization were broken during his stay and five major Canadian experiments were performed. Canadian scientific activities covered a wide range of disciplines including physical sciences (the colloid experiment BCAT-C1), radiation dosimetry (the use of neutron bubble detectors in the Radi-N2 project), life sciences (cardiovascular experiments such as BP Reg and Vascular), technology demonstration (flight of the bioanalysis instrument Microflowl) and outreach (Tomatosphere III). The Canadian-built robotic arm system (Canadarm2, Dextre and its base (SSRMS) was used for general maintenance and to capture the SpaceX, Orbital and HTV vehicles, demonstrating it is a critical link in the ISS resupply system, in addition to its continuing role in ISS inspection and maintenance. Chris Hadfield's mission was also the focus of many outreach and educational activities, including videos on scientific payloads and on the introduction of the new Canadian 5$ bill showcasing Canadian space robotics. Finally, Chris Hadfield starred alongside the ISS, in the first music video shot in space, his version of David Bowie's song 'Space Oddity'. The popularity of his mission on social networks has certainly contributed to raise the interest of the world regarding the role of the ISS as a stepping stone for human space flight beyond Low Earth Orbit.",,Amphibious vehicles; Manned space flight; Orbits; Robotics; Space flight; Space stations; Construction completion; Educational activities; Human spaceflights; Inspection and maintenance; International Space stations; Neutron bubble detectors; Scientific activity; Scientific payloads; Earth (planet),,,,"International Astronautical Federation, IAF",00741795,9781634399869,,,English,"Proc.

In particular the medium's ability to record three-dimensional objects, as with the holograms made of John Harrison's famous fourth timekeeper ""H4"" for the Royal Observatory, National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, and the strange case of Professor Günter von Hagen and his ""BODY WORLDS: The Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies,"" who seriously explored its potential but relinquished its further exploration due to negative public opinion of his exhibitions at that time. Holographic stereograms are also discussed, in particular their ability to capture animation, as detailed in Case Study Three: Holograms of David Bowie.

Slimane's reputation is founded on having streamlined and rejuvenated the male silhouette through the promotion of a skinny style appropriated from youth subcultures. Slimane's rebranding of the Dior menswear line (from the fusty Christian Dior Monsieur to the hip Dior Homme) adapted a range of urban street styles to suit the in-house tradition of classicism and bourgeois elegance. This article sets out to assess the designer's conscious reworking of masculinity, replacing virile men with skinny boys, perceived as the clearest paradigm shift in male fashion imagery since Armani, as well as tracking Slimane's impact on the landscape of contemporary fashion. Along with Tom Ford, Slimane is emblematic of the rise of the ""creative director"" engineering not only the various collections but also the brand's visual identity right down to store design and the architecture of the Dior Homme boutiques worldwide. This article situates Slimane's designs more broadly within the history of popular culture and the visual arts through a contextual focus on his cultural references and influences (notably David Bowie's Berlin and the British rock music scene), alongside coverage of his recent photographic work on American youth cultures. © 2013 Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.",Contemporary menswear; Masculinity; Mod fashion; Visual culture,,"Barthes, R., (1990) The Fashion System, , [1967], Trans.

Their value in enhancing performance is hardly a secret. Would Byron and Shelley have been the creative force they were without the aid of laudunum? Would David Bowie have made Station to Station if he hadn't been caught in a cocaine blizzard? Would John Lennon have written 'Tomorrow Never Knows' on caffeine? Should sleep-deprived surgeons be encouraged to take modafinil, a brain stimulant known to boost memory and brain power? But if you're Ben Johnson or Lance Armstrong, down that road lies only disqualification, betrayal and global opprobrium. But is the sports star who looks for an edge, who looks to go further, really any different? And if not, why do we treat them differently? Since musicians, writers and dancers also compete with each other for our pockets and affections, albeit in a less directly confrontational manner, is it fair to stigmatize sportspeople for using chemistry to enhance our enjoyment?

David Bowie. Pink Floyd. Rebel rockers and provokers of the public, vivid in our memories as much for their subversion of the mainstream as for their signature sounds. Yet what very few people realize is that a substantive part of the weaponry used by these rockers and their contemporaries was humour: outrageous onstage antics, coded cultural references, and clever lyrical constructs were all critical to expressions ofyouth rebellion that could still slip past the powers that be.Focusing on key subversive rock humorists, Brit Wits shows how and why humour has been such a powerful catalyst and expressive force in these artists’ work. Distinguishing rock humorists from rockers who are merely sometimes humorous, Iain Ellis focuses on those whose musicand persona exude defiance— beginning with the Beatles, the Kinks, and Pink Floyd; and continuing through the Smiths, the Slits, and even the Spice Girls— to investigate the nature of rock humour and the ways in which these groups have used it to attack prevailing social structures. Politics and issues of gender, class, and race are alllaid open to ridicule, as is the music industry itself – epitomized by the Sex Pistols’ scathing ' EMI'. And although lyrics are foregrounded, Ellis demonstrates thata guitar solo, dissident dance move, or antisocial hairstyle may in context be every bit as subversive and humorous as a song.At once an action- packed look at some of themost notorious rebels of British rock history and a celebration of an underexplored area of humour, Brit Wits compiles essays and critical profiles that look at one of the most effective - and entertaining - means of anti-establishment expression for half a century. © 2012 Intellect Ltd.

The mysterious quality of 'presence' in a performer has strong resonances with the uncanny. It is associated with primal, animal qualities in human individuals, but also has connotations of divinity and the supernatural, relating to figures of evil as well as heroism. Stage Presence traces these themes through theatrical history. This fascinating study also explores the blend of science and spirituality that accompanies the appreciation of human power. Performers display a magnetism of their audiences; they electrify them, exhibit mesmeric command, and develop chemistry in their communication. Case studies include: Josephine Baker, Sarah Bernhardt, Thomas Betterton, David Bowie, Maria Callas, Bob Dylan, David Garrick, Barry Humphries, Henry Irving, Vaslav Nijinsky and Paul Robeson. © 2008 Jane Goodall.

In this article I examine the work of one artist who may be music's most prodigious multiple and who may be deemed not one, but many different artists. Techno-chameleon Uwe Schmidt, aka Señor Coconut, aka Geeez 'n' Gosh, is a musician who has radically intensified the creation of multiple personae and here I situate his work as part of a contemporary technocultural moment; one where recent technologies have further enabled, destigmatized, and for some individuals, made preferable or even necessary, the idea of the performed, multiple identity. As such, by enacting certain key concepts of a postmodern and/or posthuman conception of identity, artists like Schmidt thus problematize traditional modes of artistic representation, marketing, and reception that were previously based upon notions of individual authorship.

Arranged roughly chronologically from early 1950s rock and roll to late 1990s techno, I discuss how many artists, such as Bill Haley, David Bowie and George Clinton, have used such imagery to promote various nonconformist ideologies and identities ranging from African-American empowerment to Gay and Lesbian agendas. This article also relates developments in scientific space research and popular science fiction culture to corresponding uses of space and alien imagery in various forms of popular music. In general, popular music's use of futuristic space and alien themes denotes a related neo-Gnostic withdrawal and alienation from traditionally dominant cultural structures in an attempt to unite us with a common 'other' that transcends divisions of race, gender, sexual preference, religion or nationality.

White [see number 1 of “References” at end of paper] observed that negative anomalies were found over synclines, and that positive anomalies occurred over anticlines. Bowie [2] and Miller [3] both pointed out that positive anomalies were found in regions of exposed pre‐Cambrian rocks, and that negative anomalies were observed over Cenozolc sediments. ©1936.

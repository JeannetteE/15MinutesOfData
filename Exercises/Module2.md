(thanks to Lorna Wildgaard, lowi AT kb.dk for inspiration to the exercise)

# Search in Scopus for David Bowie
# Use advanced search

– follow the steps - Since Scopus helps you with built in features …

# TITLE-ABS-KEY(david w/4 bowie) AND NOT AUTHOR-NAME(bowie)

- Look at the result, visualize via Scopus to be familiar with the result
- Download the result as .csv file
- Check the content via Excel if needed
- Save the file for next time… as *.csv

*If there is time, sign up / create an account for Scopus.
- Save the search in your profile for later

# finally you can use your *.csv file for a short visualisation via [ScienceScape](http://medialab.github.io/sciencescape/)

We have now been "quickly through" some Data Science methods - by use of our own licensed materials (metadata from Scopus) to cleaning it via the open science tool called OpenRefine.

# this exercise and introduction is all about Visualising and understanding our dataset"

## Learning Objectives will be:

<u>... after the introduction the participants </u>
- will know of and be able to start to work with VosViewer <p>
- can import search results from Web of Science or Scopus to VosViewer <p>
- can create simple bibliometric/network visualizations in VosViewer <p>


* Data from Web of Science to VosViewer - make sure to select Core Collection, and "Save to Other File Format" and choose Tab-Delimited File Format. Finally choose the Full Record inkl Cited References option.

* Data from Scopus to VosViewer - make sure you export data as ".csv" and that all data elements are included. I normally leave out Funding details & other information, but I of course *Include Reference*

#### **Module 1**

First session will introduce a Tool for beginners.

We will look at the website [DataBasic.io](https://databasic.io/en) - and explore the 4 features presented



- Wordcounter
- WTF CSV
- SameDiff
- Connect the Dots

Since it is only 15 minutes Hands-on, the intro will run through the 4 features superficially, but the idea is, that after the session, colleagues will find the time for a "deeper dive into the tool".
